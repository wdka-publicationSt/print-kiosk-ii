As a result of the financial crisis and ongoing social transitions, old certainties have become fluid and new business models are emerging: business models in which the basis of multiple value creation is provided by new and existing cash flows, local entrepreneurship, social capital, open networks, energy transition and new technologies. An increasing number of designers and artists play an important role in the development of these new business models.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p>Author: Iris Schutten\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_new_design_practice\">A new design practice</span></h3>\n<p>A new design practice is emerging, one which no longer focuses solely on designing a beautiful table, a good building or a pleasant neighbourhood, but also considers the processes in which these designs were realised as a design challenge in itself. An increasing number of designers share their designs according to open source principles, and allow consumers to influence the creation process by participating in its development, financing or fabrication. For example, initiatives such as Space&amp;matter's 'CRWDBLDNG', 'Blauwhoed' and 'Open Development', and the project 'Wikihouse' by strategy office 00://. We are increasingly witnessing the emergence of new forms of ownership; local initiatives are claiming vacant buildings, people can lease jeans instead of buying them, and small groups of individuals are setting up neighbourhood energy cooperatives. Additionally, the circular economy is increasingly perceived as a way out of the current ecological and economic crises. For example, projects such as Superuse Studios' 'Villa Welpeloo', Duzan Doepel's 'Biobased Retrofit House', and 'De Ceuvel' by Metabolic Lab and Space&amp;matter. In such projects, local issues (waste products, energy, local communities and expertise) become valuable assets. In all these projects, the designers have not only designed the physical final object, but also contributed to designing the relevant business model, which in turn plays a role in defining the physical manifestation of the design. In other words, this type of participation in the design of the context opens up new possibilities for the physical design. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Wikihouse2.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"WikiHouse Model\"><img alt=\"WikiHouse Model\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/cd/Wikihouse2.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"514\" /></a>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Wikihouse3.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"The first non-prototype WikiHouse was part of the Gwangju Design Biennale 2011 in South Korea.\"><img alt=\"The first non-prototype WikiHouse was part of the Gwangju Design Biennale 2011 in South Korea.\" src=\"/wiki/images/c/c1/Wikihouse3.jpg\" width=\"1430\" height=\"1068\" /></a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_Practices\">Social Practices</span></h3>\n<p>Designers whose work practice is based on this type of perspective regarding the scope of their professional field, are active in what can be considered as 'social practices'. Social practices are gaining in popularity these days, with an increasing number of projects, publications and conferences on the subject. For example, two books presented recently at the Dutch Design Week 2014: 'Social Design for Wicked Problems' and 'Looks Good, Feels Good, Is Good', as well as conferences such as 'What Design Can Do' and 'Rethink'. This development seems to pick up on work done ten years ago by artists such as Jeanne van Heeswijk and Sabrina Lindemann, for example the project 'De Strip' in Vlaardingen and 'OpTrek Transvaal' in The Hague. \n</p><p>The resurgence of social practices in the contemporary discourse of art, design and education should come as no surprise: it is a reaction to a society in a state of transition. Though our society has always been changing, currently these changes seem to be taking place faster, more intensively and more broadly than what we had previously been accustomed to. Many believe that the future will not be merely an extrapolation of the present and the familiar, but that there are systemic shifts taking place simultaneously on several levels, in various disciplines and on different scales. Whether this change of system turns out to be relatively large or small, an important characteristic of social practitioners is that they explicitly choose to research and critically examine such change, and to play a role in its design. Competent social designers and social artists can position themselves in an original way as game changers. It is not surprising that many designers are currently active in this field. On one hand, the time seems ripe to work on the development of alternative business models; the old ways of doing business no longer work or have proven undesirable. On the other hand, tools from the creative disciplines - such as design thinking and systemic analysis - help make it possible to design new business models.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Change_of_system\">Change of system</span></h3>\n<p>Though some believe that once we have made it through the current economic crisis, we will go back to the way things were before, others argue that the world of tomorrow will be very different from that of yesterday. The Russian Economist Nikolai Kondratiev has convincingly argued that crises are always preceded by social revolutions, for example the industrial revolution or the introduction of the automobile. What all these crises have in common is that the world before and after the crisis is completely different; with different organisational structures, new business models, and new players in charge. If we consider the current crisis a similar tipping point, this can become an opportunity for re-thinking the creative disciplines as well as existing business models. \n</p><p>During the past century, citizens had gradually become dependent on an economic structure which was increasingly uniform and large-scale, and regulated according to top-down models. New generations, on the other hand, seem to increasingly make use of more horizontal structures, while operating through various (invisible) networks and expressing their social and political engagement through quick and flexible structures.  At the same time, we can also observe a movement in the opposite direction: ever-increasing consumption, individualisation, increase of scale, and clustering of power in the hands of a smaller number of larger multinationals; as well as exhaustion of natural resources, peak oil, plastic soup, the exploitation of people, animals and the planet, and ever-increasing income inequality. Another important factor is large-scale migration streams, with the associated refugee dramas and xenophobia. Furthermore, we are faced with new challenges in the fields of ageing demographics, social care and healthcare, economic and demographic shrinkage, and food and water shortages. \n</p><p>Sailing on the choppy waves of such complex developments, various thinkers and designers are proposing a change of system; a switch from large-scale to small-scale structures, from large initial investments to more gradual cash flow plannings, from organisations with a few professionals in charge to practices with a large number of players, from final situation to initial situation, from trust in standard methods to experimentation with new ones, from financial gain to multiple value creation.\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Retrofit_biobased_businesscase.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Biobased Retrofit House by Doepel Strijkers Architecten\"><img alt=\"Biobased Retrofit House by Doepel Strijkers Architecten\" src=\"/wiki/images/a/a5/Retrofit_biobased_businesscase.jpg\" width=\"1869\" height=\"748\" /></a>\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:ActiveReUseHouse.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Active Reuse House by Doepel Strijkers Architecten\"><img alt=\"Active Reuse House by Doepel Strijkers Architecten\" src=\"/wiki/images/a/af/ActiveReUseHouse.jpg\" width=\"591\" height=\"443\" /></a>\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Redesigning_Business\">Redesigning Business</span></h3>\n<p>Mapping, shifting the perspective, reframing and the ability to bring various stakeholders together are all skills which are especially relevant in the context of a change of system. Social practices can play a valuable role here. Two constantly recurring aspects in social practices are: the introduction of the time factor in the development process, and the focus on the existing situation \u2013 the people, networks, buildings, knowledge, expertise, materials and needs that are already present. In social practices, designers connect these local forces in such a way that allows for new perspectives, which are given the time to develop step by step, so that new visions on ownership and capital can emerge. \n</p><p>Obviously, this is not always a simple process. A change of system always requires a great deal of patience, daring and perseverance, as well as improvisational ability, systems analysis and change management. As a consequence, the field of art and design education is also changing. Since 2011, the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague offers the new master programme 'INSIDE'; the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam offers 'Social Practices' as one of its three new interdisciplinary graduation profiles; and the Design Academy in Eindhoven offers the master programme 'Social Design'. In other countries, this change is also acknowledged, for example in Baltimore (Center for Social Design) and at Budapest's Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design(EcoLab). All these programmes are based on the idea that interdisciplinarity is now a reality, and change management has become a necessity in order to supersede existing practices. \n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Interact.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Interact, In Situ architecten for Mobiel Projektburo OpTrek Transvaal, Den Haag\"><img alt=\"Interact, In Situ architecten for Mobiel Projektburo OpTrek Transvaal, Den Haag\" src=\"/wiki/images/e/e9/Interact.jpg\" width=\"440\" height=\"330\" /></a>\n</p><p>There is no blueprint for how to proceed and that is a good thing too. However, a specific attitude can clearly be observed: an attitude which links ideals to decisiveness and imagination, with and in the here and now, and without becoming preachy or patronising. This is the attitude that will bring welcome change to part of the world of art and design. \n</p><p><i>Iris Schutten, 2014</i>\n</p>\n<i>Iris Schutten coordinates the Social Practices at the Willem

But where exactly do they live? For my project Retour Afzender I went looking for these places and visualised this research in a multimedia project. I began Retour Afzender as a photojournalist project. Registering as a volunteer worker for Dutch asylum centres, I was able to enter a parallel universe that is normally hidden to the public, even to news media. I ended up not simply taking pictures, but also researching the system of Dutch asylum procedures, and documenting the many steps of this system through images and text on a website. The conclusion of my research was simple: that the purpose of these procedures is to get the refugees out of the country again.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p>Author: Lou Muuse\n</p><p>Website: www.retourafzender.eu\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:WebsiteRA.jpg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Retour Afzender\"><img alt=\"Retour Afzender\" src=\"/wiki/images/3/38/WebsiteRA.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"2234\" /></a>\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Storytelling\">Storytelling</span></h2>\n<p>The most important goal for this project was to combine all the different information into a clear overview of the Dutch asylum system. At the beginning I already knew I didn't want to make just a book. A book can have a 'closed' character and I wanted to use my project to 'spread the word'. Therefore I decided I had to make a website where all the elements of the storytelling would come together. It isn't enough to simply view a photo on the web. For me the idea of an interactive website immediately felt right. I had found a new way to tell the asylum story.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Photography\">Photography</span></h3>\n<p>Photography is the foundation of my project. With my photos I want to present an open-minded view of the provisional locations where refugees stay during the asylum process. I did this by shooting the interiors of the locations, and tried not show any people in these pictures. I did this primarily so that people could identify more easily with the locations. Also, there are already many photography projects about refugees focusing on people as the subject.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Icons\">Icons</span></h3>\n<p>For the storytelling of the asylum system, I needed more than photography; I also used illustrations, maps, text and infographics. With the illustrations I visualised the steps in the asylum procedure. On my website, each step is a different location in the system. Here it was essential to work with icons to present the information visually. All asylum seeker centres use icons to present information visually to the asylum seekers. Most asylum seekers don't speak Dutch when they arrive here, which is why symbols are used for communication.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mapping\">Mapping</span></h3>\n<p>It was important to show where asylum seekers are located in the country. I used maps to do this. Asylum seekers experience the Netherlands in a completely different way as we do. They see a lot of very weird place names, which most Dutch people themselves have never heard of. The asylum seekers centres are far away from the big cities. Most of the centres are in the east of the Netherlands. Sometimes there is no public transportation, isolating the asylum seekers even more from Dutch society.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Language\">Language</span></h3>\n<p>For this project I used many different elements to present an overview of the asylum system and the provisional locations. You can see the project on the website www.retourafzender.eu. Please note that all the text on the website is in Dutch. Also, keep in mind that the Dutch government communicates in the Dutch language with the asylum seekers and refugees, though most asylum seekers don't speak Dutch.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Discussion\">Discussion</span></h3>\n<p><i>The editorial board invites readers to reflect and react on the following question: </i>\n</p><p><i>After graduation, the project Retour Afzender was further developed in print in collaboration with the WdKA's Hybrid Publishing Practices. Researching and experimenting across a broad range of processes native to digital and analog media, Hybrid Publishing Practices fosters novel approaches to design, writing, reading and dissemination, and embraces the pluriformity of publishing made possible through the legacies of Gutenberg's press to present-day technologies. This resulted in a beautiful publication which will be presented at the Beyond Social event during the final examination event 'WdKA Finals 2016'. But in what sense is this publication hybrid? What is the ideal hybrid publication, and why? We are looking forward to your contributions.</i>\n</p><p>Photography<br />\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\"

In this work, but also in her other works she tries to make the lines between raw products, producers and consumers visible again that have become so invisible in our increasingly globalized world. \n<p>PIG 05049 is a research she has done about one pig, she followed all the pieces around the world to see what would become from them. There were a lot of surprising products, that she all gathered in a book called PIG 05049.\n</p><p>The product and exhibition shows the public the hidden process behind a large amount of our daily used products. It makes a part of the economy transparent again. That transparency is for a big amount lost in the process of the industrialization.\nA reaction to a ted talk she did was; she brings us the information we don't know about our everyday products, but do we really want to know all this information?\n</p><p>The project aligns perfectly with the class open design. Because this project is all about opening up the process behind our products from one material. She shows us what we cannot see because of the invisibility of today\u2019s economy. The project is contextual if you see it from her perspective, she shows something that a everyday person can\u2019t see but they want to know it, or maybe they do not want to know like said in the ted talk. \nThe artistic aspect of this project is in the way of presentation. How she forms the exhibition and the publication are done in an artistic way. Also her own view and interests made her do this project, she might do it more from her own perspective then to show the public what happens with a pig after it\u2019s killed. \nIn her project she uses different resources to track the pieces of the pig, but when it comes to the public she does not ask for participation. The only thing the public does is look at the work or read the book and then the participation starts. The people that have seen or heard about the exhibition are going to talk about it, they are going to wander about what else is in our food and everyday products. This way,  she tries to create some transparency in our industrialized world.  This is also the transformative aspect. It is the base for new perspectives and it offers the opportunity for critical reflection. Because it is about a product that everyone in the world knows, maybe they do not eat it directly, but everyone has come in to contact with something from a pig once in his life. She brings it in that way closer to everyone. \n</p><p>The project creates awareness in the public , but it is also informational. The project has started with the artist herself and not in the community. So with the schedule in minde we made in the lesson this project will be in the middel of allo-relational and auto-relational and somewhere a bit more to the subversive side. Because she is not working particularly with the community but she is not totally auto-relational. Also she is not completely against the current power, but with the project she activates the people to think about the daily things en to do not take everything for granted. \n</p><p>The reason why I think this project is a good social project is because it has three of the four core qualities that are written in the \u201cart in transition manifesto\u201d. But in my  opinion the only thing that is missing is the real connection with the public. The public is important to the project because without them the project would not be relevant, but the public could be more involved in the whole proces, for instance to work together with a community to search for the end stations for the pieces of the pig. Let the people work with you as an artist so it can become so much more than a collection of different products with pieces of a pig inside. That is simplistic but it is clear what i mean. \nThe good thing about this project is that she tries to make a difference, she tries to get the transparency back that we used to have before the industrialization. This is something what I value highly, because I think a huge amount of money en ideas get lost in the proces. We can work efficient with energy and all that kind of stuff but not in this sort of situations. That is something Christien tries to change. \n</p>\nWhat i see for this project is to make it even more extensive with even more materials. So in the long run every product we use is completely transparent. This can be done trough open source technologies and sharing of all our information. But this takes a lot of responsibility that comes with it.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n </div>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Links\">Links</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span

Usually there is nothing you can do about it. You inevitably become friends with people on Facebook who will regularly post things that you make you feel agitated. In the virtual reality game <b>Facebook Therapy VR</b>, it is possible to deal with your frustrations physically.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Impression.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Impression.png\" src=\"/wiki/images/8/8d/Impression.png\" width=\"1440\" height=\"795\" /></a>\n</p><p>In Facebook Therapy (Virtual Reality), it is ultimately not the type of Facebook posts that are important. Instead, it all comes down to the frustration itself and how players express this frustration in the game. Through this frustration I want to make players aware of the emotional influence Facebook has on their life and also to make them stop and think about how and why they are frustrated with content on Facebook.\n</p><p>The game's goal is to destroy annoying FaceBook posts that pop up in your virtual home environment. You do so by throwing a (virtual) ball at these posts. Over time the frequency of these posts increases and often will black out your surroundings, so they stand out even more. The more posts you are able to destroy, the higher your final score.\n</p><p>The learning goal of this game is to offer the player an experience to become aware of the emotional influence Facebook has on his or her life. An important part of the installation is the reflection after the game. Players are asked about their experience and new insights that arose during and after the game.

Countries that have no strong media presence are under the mercy of how dominant media displays them. Valuable cultures, traditions, rituals that have been developed in ancient societies that serves as inspiration and to assist people in defining their purpose is being  othered and marginalized by what dominant media defines and displays them as. \n</p>\nThe more your presence becomes othered and marginalized the less you believe in the validity of your perspective in seeing the world. This causes a systematic lack of self-esteem where your possibility of reaching self-actualization becomes less possible. You get less control over your behavior and reaction which creates behavioral errors and makes you even more vulnerable to exclusion. I research the human consciousness through neuropsychology and culture to understand the narrow and biased information we uphold about the world and our own capacities to stress the importance of producing a more inclusive media archive that challenges our structure of thoughts.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</span></h3>\n<p>My parents were surprised when I continued watching animated films and series after reaching an age where they would expect me to develop other interests. I enjoyed watching animation to an extent where my first love is even a fictional character. When I was a child, the animations on screen were subtitled, but I couldn\u2019t read yet. So, along with Turkish at home and Dutch at school I had learned English from watching animation. My parents took pride in having a child who mumbled three different languages. My family moved around a lot and I was a very shy child, my tool to make friends in new schools was by drawing cartoon characters for my classmates to impress them. It wasn\u2019t until I went to high school that I landed in an environment where my classmates wouldn\u2019t be interested in cartoon characters anymore, so I left that as a tool to bond and just became an ordinary teenager.   The first three years of high school was very  dissatisfying for me until I got a classmate that  introduced me to a new wave of Japanese animations online that were available to be seen with English  subtitles. I went home to watch the first episode of Death Note (Tetsuro Araki, 2006-7) on YouTube and it was the first time for me to see an animation with such elevated aesthetics and visuals, it was unlike anything that I had ever seen before. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, it was visually so incredible, and the story was unlike anything I had ever watched that it compensated the way Japanese sounded to me, a language which I had never heard. I couldn\u2019t distinguish a sound from one another but by the end of the series I could sing along to the intro music, differentiate words from each other and developed an interest to the culture, I wanted more. The story was about An intelligent high school student goes on a secret crusade to eliminate criminals from the world after discovering a notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written into it. (imdb)  The discoveries that followed Death Note has led me  to go back to drawing, it wasn\u2019t only the fascination towards the aesthetics of the animations that I watched, but also the narratives that were different from what I consumed on Dutch TV which were dominantly  American. The idea of a young person in power of  adjusting the justice system like in Death Note just opened up doors of questions and possibilities. \n</p><p>The older I got, the more I understood how complicated the world around me was and how language plays a big role in that. Having a diverse cultural background, I was an outsider everywhere I went to. I was Turkish in the Netherlands and European in Turkey. Growing up with multiple languages has also earned me praise  but made me half a person in every language I spoke. This created situations where I would feel extremely uncomfortable to speak up because I would not have the self esteem to represent myself well. This became especially more of a problem when tension towards people with a migrant background or Muslim belief would elevate with the ongoing and amplifying  political conflicts related to the Middle East.  \n</p><p>Consuming stories from the Japanese narrative had shaped me significantly, it was the story structures from Japanese productions that gave me a better understanding of how I could become more of a person that I would be more comfortable being. The heroines of the animations I watched were not people for whom the universe would adjust according to their desires, the stories were always about a mutual give and take which I discovered to be a common story structure in Japanese animation. I received the guidance in life from animation that I lacked at my home and in school. The realization that animation is such a powerful tool in influencing people\u2019s behavior has brought me to this point today where I stand in a position of pursuing a career in making animated films myself. Listening to people\u2019s stories and being able to create empathy is what provokes curiosity, <i>it is when we can establish bonds of mutual understanding that we can step up to build self-esteem and reach our individual potentials (Maslow, 1987, p. 64).</i>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs_.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/7/7d/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs_.jpg/600px-Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs_.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"454\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/7/7d/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs_.jpg 1.5x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs_.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Maslow's hierarchy of needs</div></div></div></div>\n<p>As someone who has also benefitted a lot from Middle Eastern philosophy and Islamic culture I can\u2019t identify myself with the way my heritage and belief are represented and branded on dominant media and how this evolves into violent behavior towards these people in daily life. I\u2019m a living breathing proof for myself that the representation is unjust, so it became my drive to\ninvestigate how representation vs. discrimination works.  \n</p><p>Scientific racism is something that \u2018justifies\u2019 the psyche of the oppressor and the bystanders, when we realize that differences are social and not biological we share responsibilities in understanding each other without disregarding one another. to stress on the importance of telling stories of diverse backgrounds and disciplines and to break down the layers of artificial structures to oppress one another I\u2019d like the explain the importance of the stories that has been kept on hold.\n</p><p>I will explain the way human conscious and subconscious works as a mechanism by investigating reality through the perspective of neuropsychology and how culture influences our perception of ourselves and the world around us. This way I\u2019d like to convince the importance of the effect of diversity in storytelling and why animation is one of the most effective tools in that. \n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Self_-_What_you_see_is_what_you_get\">The Self - What you see is what you get</span></h3>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SELF.I\">SELF.I</span></h2>\n<p>The experience of the self is divided in neuroscience and psychology in the following categories: \n</p><p><b>Bodily self</b>: The owning and being of a body in which you are in sync with the physiological needs of the body as a self-sustaining organism. (i.e. feeling hungry, feeling sleepy, feeling energetic etc.) \n</p><p><b>Perspectival self</b>: experiencing the world from a first-person view. (i.e. in front of me, behind me etc.) \n</p><p><b>Volitional self</b>: The intention of agency and wants, needs, urges and desires.  (i.e. I want to be, I don\u2019t want to be etc.) \n</p><p>In higher levels we have: \n</p><p><b>Narrative self</b>: The narrative self is where the \u2018I\u2019 starts because you become a distinctive person over time, it\u2019s the story of ourselves built from memories associated with bodily, perspectival and volitional experiences. (i.e. My name is xx and I am born and raised in xx I am xx years old and am friends with xx my hobbies are xx etc.) \n</p><p><b>Social self</b>: the self through the perception of  others and how I am experienced through other  minds and thoughts. (i.e. am I popular? Am I loved?  Am I criticized? Etc.) (Anil Seth, 2016) \n</p><p>Despite the clear distinctive categories that explain an aspect of self we don\u2019t go through life by living theme separately, we experience all of our aspects of selves as a whole and it is the balance between those aspects that create a healthy and maybe even happy human being. The measurement of the balance of these aspects of the selves are highly subjective and personal however external circumstances which is a reality to all are elements that play a crucial role in the perception of a human being and their sense of self.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"SELF.II\">SELF.II</span></h2>\n<p>All sciences are in effort to understand the world in which we live in and to make it more comprehensible. Throughout the centuries we have developed a wide range of methodologies that examine the world from specific perspectives. How we give meaning (perception) to the information we receive (senses) is depending on several elements because we have a number of layers of experienced selves. \n</p><p>Neuroscientist Anil Seth (Ted, 2017) explains in his talk that our own consciousness is all we have that differentiates us of being objects, it is through our consciousness that we experience the world and a sense of self. Throughout our sense of self, we experience feelings of joy and suffering. There are many discussions and questions about the self, some philosophers even argue that the self does not exist (Thomas Metzinger, 2003). Without the self and all its experiences there is no use in any of the efforts in meaning making, in case of my profession as a storyteller I find this too reductant and therefor will focus on a more qualitative approach towards this subject. Anil Seth explains that there are two forms of consciousness. One is the world around us with its multi layered experiences and the other is the specific experience of being who you are, the self. Our brains are triggered by sensory information (taste, sight, smell, hearing and touch) through which our consciousness works. It is in constant effort of trying to grasp of what is out there in the world based on prior expectations and beliefs. \nSensation is useful and essential for survival, we can protect ourselves from being hurt by  removing ourselves from danger which we depict through our senses. It is also the process of detecting existence of the world around us. (John Krantz, 2013, p.1.6).  We are highly dependent on our sensory experiences to make sense of the things around us by depending on the languages of communication and our instincts in detecting safe/unsafe. Yet we confuse the important distinction between sensation and perception. Sense is quite objective, it is perception that is subjective, because, if seeing is believing is everything we see and hear the truth? \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_shape_in_which_we_think\">The shape in  which we think</span></h3>\n<p>Sensation and perception are interwoven to each other, just like our senses of self. We always experience the world through our sense of self and therefor find it normal that we experience the things the way they are. Our faith in our senses delay us from the fundamental questions such as why we experience things the way we do. Thomas Metzinger does explain an insightful perspective about the self being an ongoing property where we have a sense of ownership over our inner selves in relationship to the outside world and that our sense of selves are very context sensitive and fluid and thus can be manipulated.    \n</p><p>Our unquestioned faith in our senses and the fine line between what is sense and what is perceptive is also the reason for arrogance, we experience the world always through our sense of self and thus will always assume that we are the center of the universe unless critically challenged to think otherwise. Just like David Foster Wallace cites in his commencement speech \n</p><p><i>\u201c: The most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.. .. blind certainty \u2013 a close mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s locked up\u201d</i>   \n</p><p>According to Anil Seth, we are all hallucinating all the time and perception is a controlled hallucination where the brain\u2019s predictions about the meaning concerning the received sensory experiences is what we consider \u2018reality\u2019, in fact, reality is us agreeing on what we see. The act of speech is for example the act of transmitting thought by sounds which we make with our mouths by hissing and puffing, those actions create air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations hit the eardrums of the receiver. What follows is the brain taking those vibration from the eardrums and translating them to thoughts (Lera Boroditsky, 2017). So even though quantitative research allows us to understand the ways in which we interact and communicate it is still qualitative research that explores the meaning and significance of a situation. Qualitative research concerns itself with all things in motion, never set and always changing depending on the participants and ongoing change in circumstances.  \n</p><p>Senses are self-evident, the act of absorbing and imitating the communicative skills to survive is also something which is self-evident because we need to be able to communicate our needs. Conscious experience is an integrated reality (Thomas Metzinger, 2013) meanings regulate our volitional and narrative selves and these set the rules and norms in which our social life is ordered and governed in. Meaning in which we construct reality out of is always partially understood (Stuart Hall, Representation,p.4) Having a brain and having a nervous system from which your brain senses the world is self-evident but the meaning and perception you give to all of these senses are absolutely not hardwired in us like our height, skin color or family members. The meaning we give to the sensorial experience is entirely dependent on our belief template and narrative self-experiences which consist out of social values such as financial status, climate experience, the culture or society group we belong to. We do automatically absorb the language of the culture we are born into, but we do that to be able to function. The history of a language depends on years of evolution that contributed to that tool of meaning making which again differentiates from area to area. So, the exact same thing in the world can mean absolutely two different things to different individuals. In the past Europe would be governed by the narrative of the Christian religion, Sundays in church were the portion of narrative that guided people through life. Maybe that was even their only portion of a narrative and was the sustaining of life something that took enough time to occupy the mind and prevent it from asking questions about systems and why god was a man for example. But the industrial revelation and the automation of so many things have changed everything. Today, as soon as we are awake we begin to consume stories. Population has grown, nearly all of us own social media where we \u2018construct\u2019 our identities, we get breaking news on daily basis. I am primarily fascinated by witnessing my nieces watching animation on tablets and phones. Today we have more utilities and access to material that investigates what it means to be a human being today but maybe we have so much of it that our brains just got immune to those senses.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Culture_-_How_you_see_is_what_you_get\">Culture - How you see is what you get</span></h3>\n<p><i>\u201cCulture internally is concerned with the production  and exchange of meanings which we can access through language. So, language serves as a  representational system.\" </i>\n- Stuart Hall, 1997 \n</p><p>Sciences have developed methods to guarantee outcome in quantitative methods. These experiments have helped humanity in understanding the way our bodies work or our planet and universe. The most reliable source towards meaning making or the experience of the self is culture.   \n</p><p><i>\u201cCulture is used to refer to whatever is distinctive about the \u2018way of life\u2019 of a people, community, nation or social group\u2019. Culture is concerned with the production and exchange of meanings \u2018the giving and taking\u2019 of meaning between the members of a society or group. To say that two people belong to the same culture is to say that they interpret the world in roughly the same ways and can express themselves, their thoughts and feelings about the world, in ways which will be understood by each other. Thus, culture depends on its participants interpreting meaningfully what is happening around them, and \u2018making sense\u2019 of the world in broadly similar ways.\u201d</i> \n- Stuart Hall, Representation, p.2  \n</p><p>This proves that stories do not materialize from a void but grow out of materials already available in history and human experience. There are about 7000 different languages around the world and they all differ from each other in sounds, structures and vocabularies (Lera Boroditsky, 2017). This means we have 7000 different cognitive realms and ways of experiencing the exchange of meaning. If language is a way of transmitting knowledge about experiences than that could mean that depending on the language you speak you can construct reality. for example, in the English language, we have the word <i>nostalgia</i> which translates to the experience of yearning to a past which you cannot retrieve. The Japanese version of the word nostalgia is Natsukashii \u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044 which translates to the experience of looking back to the past with an appreciation for having that memory. The experience is more like that of the word \u2018reminiscence\u2019 but both nostalgia and reminiscence translate to \u2018natsukashii\u2019 in Japanese. They have no word f\u0131r yearning to go back to the past because the Japanese culture didn\u2019t feel the need to verbalize such a feeling. Another example is that in Turkish you talk about the other as \u2018o\u2019, it is a way of referring to another person but without the revealing of their gender. There is no he or she in Turkish and no gender nouns towards object this also changes the experience of the perception of the material realm. These might be details which are self evident for the users making them unaware of that distinction but research by Dr.Lera Boroditsky as presented in her talk shows that the language you use guide the things you pay attention to in life. \u201clanguage guides our reasonings around events.\u201d  \n</p><p>Another very critical point she makes towards the end of her talk is that everything we know about the human mind is based on studies of American/ English speaking undergraduates at universities and this means that it excludes all other human beings and what their contribution could be towards the understanding of the human mind. She correctly points out that our knowledge is narrow and biased. Linguistic diversity is not only about understanding the way how people live around the world it is also an opportunity for ourselves to question why we think the way we do.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Influencer\">The Influencer</span></h2>\n<p>Groups of people that have no strong media presence are under the mercy of how dominant media displays them. Valuable cultures, traditions, rituals that have been developed in ancient societies to assist people in defining their purpose is being othered and marginalized by what dominant media defines and displays them as. The danger with normalizing the de-humanized state in which people are being portrayed is to allow them suffering at the hand of ill intentioned groups in power. We have no immediate contact with the senses and are thus depending on how they are represented to us.\n</p><p><i>\u2018The notion about bringing civilization to primitive or barbaric peoples, the disturbingly familiar ideas about flogging or death or extended punishment being required when \u2018they\u2019 misbehaved or became rebellious, because \u2018they\u2019 mainly understood force or violence best; \u2018they\u2019 were not like \u2018us\u2019, and for that reason deserved to be ruled.</i>\n-Edward Said, Culture And Imperialism, p.xiii \n</p><p>Everything we create we do so with the urge to translate our subjective experiences into the physical world which will make it possible for others to see, analyze and agree or disagree on (Brigit Bundesen, 2018). We are kidding ourselves when we produce work within the world of art and design with an \u2018objective\u2019 positioning assuming it to be \u2018universal\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 (Ruben Pater, 2016). When we investigate what \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018universal\u2019 means internally, how legit is it to even have that as a standard or ideal. \n</p><p>It is the governing perceptive from the collective agency that lingers in the mind of humans to classify fellow human being and to practice behavior upon them which will be a part of the narrative selves. This bares great consequential risks. Unfortunately, because we are driven with the force of survival we can behave in a very ugly way to our fellow human beings and surroundings. Just look at the news or history books; war, genocide, rape, slavery, torture, exploitation are all things that have happened and still linger amongst us. All the acts of violence committed out of disagreement on what reality should be. We classify people based on gender, race, sexual orientation and religion. We build these social constructions and agree on it. We punish and reward people as a result of these social constructions. We become aware of being an \u2018other\u2019 when we don\u2019t share the characteristics to make us privileged. \n</p><p><i>\u201cThe arbitrary-set system is filled with socially constructed and highly salient groups based on characteristics such as clan,\u00a0ethnicity, estate, nation, race, caste, social class,\u00a0religious\u00a0sect, regional groups, or any other socially relevant group distinction that the human imagination is capable of constructing\u201d</i> \n-Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999, p. 33 \n</p><p>Dr.Brigit Bundesen describes the state of suffering as a consequence of communication. Humans are very vulnerable in the face of a story, especially at infancy. The reason why we are so vulnerable towards stories is because stories are equipment for living (Kenneth Burke, 1974). As children we learn language because we need to be able to function and vocalize our needs, that is how our selves develops (Birgit Bundesen, 2018). What falls under language is not limited to the linguistic one, although we are accustomed to use that as the primary way of self-expression, we learn from infancy on a multitude of languages which we actively use. A habit is always difficult to explain in intellectual terms, because it feels so natural and self-evident.(Ien Ang, 1982) \n</p><p><i>\u201cOnce the public has decided to accept something as an interesting fact, it becomes almost impossible to get the acceptance rescinded. The persistent interestingness and symbolic  usefulness overrides any lack of factuality.\u201d</i>\n-Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Great Eskimo I I Vocabulary Hoax I and Other Irreverent Essays on the Study of Language, 1991 \n</p><p>If the only representation we receive from the other is through the media coverage than we face the danger of being immersed in an unquestioned version of a single story (Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 2009). The Northern hemisphere is the area which is in control of influence, so powerful that it distributes a spectrum of stories of itself. We need more heroes of color that come from all sort of different places from the world because the metropolises are a micro representation of the diversity in the whole world. Social attitudes change, and makers must gain more awareness of this and have to be able to display stories that represents the richness in diversity. To keep on a tradition of celebrating one type of heroine and one type of antagonists is not storytelling, it is an act of upholding stereotypes. Children especially must be able to watch suitable role models on screen, they need to know that they matter. Kids now can operate a tablet sooner than they learn to walk and they watch everything. It is in infancy where we really place down our fundamental ways of perception. It takes more effort to un-learn false narratives and stereotypes because we\u2019ll be blinded as adults unless harshly confronted with our narrative selves. Inclusive representation in animation is absolutely crucial.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"I.Film\">I.Film</span></h2>\n<p>There is a persistent impulse in our culture that finds professions or practices which show material result as the only ones that are worthy of respect. \u2018only through imagination, which is always subjective, is objective reality assimilated: a life without imagination does not exist.\u2019(Ien Ang, Watching Dallas). My fascination towards cinema has made me an empathetic person, I experienced that the mundane language of words fails to express subjective experiences but by distancing ourselves from our own identity and watching a character go through hardships on the screen we can learn from them and establish a better understanding of what we go through. Thanks to film, we can travel beyond the border of our own imagination and physical realms. We don\u2019t question all the languages which we use such as traffic signs or letters, they serve their purpose and will remain unquestioned unless they cause an error, like a traffic accident, than we will start questioning the function and if it fulfills its purpose. Poetics which are founded in the art of storytelling are the opposite of functional linguistic tools. They serve as a mirror towards our conscious and subconscious self where we are confronted with the weight and nuance of life and are made to think. We are drawn to each other\u2019s stories to learn about how others cope with the weight of existence and death.   \n</p><p>An even more powerful and truer form of storytelling is animation. Animation does not rely on the existing world with its governing rules of physics. When creating animation, you create an entire altered cosmology of existence. You fill up a blank space with meaning and purpose, the creator will be continuously confronted with the question \u2018what if?\u2019  \n</p><p><i>\u201cThe motive is always psychological; the artist must have something to communicate, for mastery over form is not his goal, but rather the adapting of the form to inner significance. That is beautiful which is produced by inner need, which springs from the soul\u201d</i> \n-Kandinsky \n</p><p>With the craft of storytelling we can challenge the perception of stereotypes by offering a more layered representation including the diversity it deserves. It is especially a critical tool because the visual language of animation is something so popular with very young audiences. An age where the subconscious is being shaped and the basic perceptions are being formed \nthat will be carried around for the rest of their lives. This will have influence on their ways of perceiving themselves and the other in a way that can contribute to their self-esteem and ability to contribute to their surroundings. Instead of creating a media archive that induces the need for consumption and where the archetypes are being reduced to stereotypes it should become a tool of poetics that will always provoke thought.  \n</p><p><i>\u201cthe art of story is the dominant cultural force in the world, and the art of film is the dominant medium of this grand enterprise.\u201d</i> \n-Robert McKee, Story, p.15\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</span></h3>\n<p><i>\u201cto tell the truth, in a world of lies and liars, an honest work of art is always an act of social responsibility\u201d</i> \n-Robert Mckee \n</p><p>All of our experiences are coming from the mechanisms of predictive perception that stem from the basic drive to stay alive, we know it will all end for us one day and therefore we seek meaning and purpose in our time here and maybe even a time after that. Thanks to the alternative narratology that I was introduced to during my high school years I could break free from my superficial positioning. Maybe universality and objectivity can become possible in a far future where we have developed ourselves towards equal circumstances but if we keep feeding our younger generations with a tradition of stereotypes we won\u2019t be able to reach that ideal equality. \nToday it feels meaningless to pursue ambitions that do not benefit to humanize back all the \u2018others\u2019 which have been de-humanized and normalized through systematic racism and discrimination to uphold power structures. Critical awareness about the self and breaking free of default certainties can only be challenged by the influence of the stories of the other. We can bond through sharing knowledge and create an understanding on the consequences of our actions.  \n</p><p>Outside of the dominant white narrative structure which we are used to consume there is an entire world filled with significant amounts of alternative communicative languages beyond that of the spoken and written word that serve as a tool of self-expression and bonding. History is an inexhaustible source of story material. Everything, everywhere and everyone has a history. By examining the culture of a community, you learn about their values and distinctive characteristics that have evolved throughout their history and values are the soul of storytelling. We need to visualize these stories to create a more inclusive animation industry. The only thing which is universal is death, we all know that we are going to die and a self-actualized human being is the one that can use their creative skills to benefit their influence zone. Whether it is your country, your city, a classmate or a sibling we have this ability of communication which we can use to benefit each other instead of oppressing one another.  \n</p><p>My research gave me a much-needed insight as I was always on a mission to reach objectivity or a universal positioning which I thought I would definitely be able to attain through the lens of sciences. Of course, I haven\u2019t found it, we can only examine what we perceive and hope that what we find leads to another discovery. Consciousness is an experience and not a tangible thing, over analyzing this creates existential dizziness. The realization that our media whether in the face of news or entertainment is not an overall or universal representation of what is out there in the world will help us strip down the artificial tools of oppression that allows human suffering. I understand that by making our similarities more evident instead of our socially constructed differences, we can strive to create a society with more inclusion and awareness of the other in an appreciative way. This is why it is crucial to tell the stories that have been kept on hold. \n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References:\">References:</span></h3>\n<p>Ang, Ien.

The playground is meant for refugee children from Syria to have a place to go, play and be creative. \n</p><p>Starting off by taking a look from the contextual part, the war in Syria has destroyed and devastated many lives and in the middle of crisis, we sometimes forget about children. At this point of their lives, they are not able to make decisions for themselves, for example, what is the best thing to do or the best place to go, so they are influenced by their parents. I find that it is very important to pay attention to the refugee children, because, in my opinion, every one of them deserves a chance to spend their childhood playing and studying from the environment, despite the war surrounding them.\n</p><p>The concept of the project was to design a playground for the refugee children where there is not only able to play an be active, but also a place to evolve creatively or take their time off. To make it as best as they could, they involved the children themselves with the process. \n</p><p>When taking the artistic approach, I think they solved it as good as they could. When designing a playground for the children, it is important to attach them to the project as well, because they are the ones who know best, what makes them happy, what do they want to play with or what do they prefer the playground to look like. So that\u2019s what they did - they held participatory exercises where the aim was to involve the kids form the very beginning of the project to give them a sense of ownership that they actually were part of the making of this project. Otherwise, it might have happened that they don\u2019t take it as their own, so this way the designers weren\u2019t people from the outside bringing something into them, but the kids were a part of imagining it, conceptualizing it and even bringing their own elements of play to the playground. In addition to the participatory exercises they did, the designers did a lot of research for themselves too about what kind of spaces they wanted to create in a relation to the act of play. \n</p><p>Continuing with the participatory part, besides the exercises with the children, they also involved people from the refugee camp to the building part. The first part of the workshop was building an easily assembled wooden structure from local materials and on site, what makes also the project environmentally very sustainable and low cost, as there is minimal transportation and building expences. And the second part was to animate the playground with the children to create all the games that were designed on site too. \n</p><p>What I really liked about the project was that they did not only design a regular playground, but they managed to create an area with three kind of spaces. An active space, for all the physical part (for example basketball court), a private space, where children can feel relaxed and do stuff they want to do (like planting flowers, as it can be seen in the video) and an educational space, where the panels they installed in the playground, have all messages about subjects or concepts they decided put there to the playground. \nWhat is transformative about this project, is that most of the children have just fled from the war and live in a refugee camps, where they are living in very harsh and restrictive environmental circumstances that doesn\u2019t allow them to \u2018be\u2019 children or express themselves that way. While doing the research, the designers found out, that before the playground was built, children fought a lot, because they had a lot of trapped energy that needed the outcome where to express it. So with that project they managed not only to pay attention to the problem, but to solve it.\n</p><p>Also, why I think this is a good social project is, because of their success, these kind of projects usually end up in global media, so they raise awareness of people all over the world about the conditions in refugee camps and maybe encourage them to take action or support others who do that and mainly because children and parents in these kind of situations can not do much about themselves. \n</p><p>In conclusion, I think that this innovative playground is a very good and successful project that really helps children in refugee camp to recreate the opportunity for them to get their thoughts away from the war, get to communicate with each other more friendly and enjoy their childhood again.\n</p><p><br />\nSource:\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.catalyticaction.org/all-project-list/playground-syrian-refugees/\">http://www.catalyticaction.org/all-project-list/playground-syrian-refugees/</a>\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/778318/catalyticaction-designs-playgrounds-for-refugee-children-as-emergency-response-in-bar-elias-lebanon\">http://www.archdaily.com/778318/catalyticaction-designs-playgrounds-for-refugee-children-as-emergency-response-in-bar-elias-lebanon</a> \n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=229&amp;v=KzgZv2J8c4E\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=229&amp;v=KzgZv2J8c4E</a>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20181012094204\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\n[SMW] In\u2010text annotation parser time: 0.001 seconds\nCPU time usage: 0.002 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.003 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 4/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 1/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n",

You are cordially invited to, from a designer perspective, compare your own practice with current innovations and theories in the field of social design and to address questions of change: what are our thoughts on how to bring about change as a designer or artist?\n</p><p>As a social designer, we hope to make meaningful changes to the people and the environment for whom we are designing. There are different perspectives on how to initiate this change. According to Pascal Gielen (2011), some of these changes focus more on working with the power structures and trying to make a difference within the boundaries of the 'System World'. Others try to make a stance against the current power structures (Gielen, 2011). \n</p><p>How do we ensure that the commons truly benefit from the changes we bring about, as opposed to the institutions? How do we cope with repressive liberalism, which is embodied in things like \u201cCorporate Social Responsibility\u201d and \u201cSustainability\u201d? In other words, do we try to challenge system standards from the inside, do we pose an alternative system or do we take a radical position against the current system?\n</p><p>Feel free to contribute by adding an article on Beyond Social!\n</p>\n</div>  \n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selected_articles\">Selected articles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Template:Editorial&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2\" title=\"Template:Editorial\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n</div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"selected-article\"><div class=\"article-preview small\">\n<div class=\"image\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:IMbinckfetsprov.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"IMbinckfetsprov.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/6/6c/IMbinckfetsprov.jpg/600px-IMbinckfetsprov.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" style=\"vertical-align: text-top\" class=\"thumbborder\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/thumb/6/6c/IMbinckfetsprov.jpg/900px-IMbinckfetsprov.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/images/thumb/6/6c/IMbinckfetsprov.jpg/1200px-IMbinckfetsprov.jpg 2x\" /></a></div><div class=\"caption\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Opening_of_the_I%27m_Binckfestival._Photo_Marc_Heeman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Opening of the I'm Binckfestival.

        "text": "<p>I. What is the program about?<br />\n</p><p>Designmatters is an educational Department at ArtCenter College of Design that engages all academic disciples taught at the college with a dynamic, entrepreneurial and experiential approach to design education and social innovation. Designmatters serves as a vibrant hub for strategic collaborations near and far from ArtCenter\u2019s campuses in Pasadena. In 2002, Designmatters established the significant and pioneering affiliation of the College as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations as part of its international outreach strategy. For more than fifteen years, the department has built a broad network of innovative research and project-based collaborations with social, public and private sector organizations regionally, nationally and internationally.<br /><br />\n</p><p>Designmatters is at the helm of a diverse set of educational initiatives, special projects and publications that demonstrate the power of design for social innovation: an emergent field of design inquiry and practice that is oriented toward new possibilities for action and human progress.<br /><br />\n</p><p>Designmatters collaborates closely with partners, faculty, and students to use the power of design to address complex challenges in the areas of Sustainable Development, Public Policy, Global Health and Social Entrepreneurship. Designmatters facilitates an exploratory, lab-like environment where the expertise of multidisciplinary faculty guides the fresh perspectives of students to uncover nuanced insights that lead to unexpected, creative and viable solutions. \u00a0 <br /><br />\n</p><p>The Department helps conceive an average of three original transdisciplinary elective courses (signature Designmatters projects open to undergraduate and graduate students from all disciplines) every academic term; manages the Designmatters Fellowship program; oversees the Designmatters Concentration for undergraduate students who choose to specialize in social impact design; and collaborates with the Graduate Media Design Practices Field Track in managing the UNICEF Innovation partnership that informs the field experience offered within this MFA curriculum.<br /><br />\n</p><p>Designmatters is equally committed to offering students a unique set of learning outcomes that come from the constraints of working collaboratively at multifaceted levels of complexity and community, as well as to acting as a guarantor with organizational partners for project implementation.<br /><br />\n</p><p>II. What should we (not) teach students within social practices?\u00a0<br /><br />\n</p><p>Through the Designmatters studio experience, students are taught design methods and tools that support social innovation outcomes. These can be categorized in approximately 3 key areas that represent pillars of the innovative pedagogy offered: <br />\n1) Co-creation and collaboration through participatory research methods:<br />\nDesign briefs are structured within a very collaborative framework that includes field research and multiple touch-points for critique and feedback with external stakeholders and potential beneficiaries of the design intervention(s) at hand.  This process is central to the learning offered and exposes students to the perspectives and expertise of actors from various sectors and disciplines.  There is an emphasis on unique participatory research methodologies that build empathy with the end-users; the objective is to address the needs and aspirations of individuals and communities in a holistic way that engages participants in cooperatively informing the design research and creative problem-solving process as much as possible throughout the overall arc of investigation and development of the project(s).<br /><br />\n</p><p>2) Trans-disciplinary and team-based project approach to collaboration: <br />\nThis is an important hallmark learning of Designmatters studios. Students from across design disciplines form teams to solve real-time/ real-world challenges in a \u201creflection-in-action\u201d mode of inquiry that enables them to actively experiment and incorporate experience-based insights, judgment and intuition. Each student brings individual life experiences, diverse cultural upbringings, and varied strengths in design skill-sets from their core academic design discipline. The collaborative process facilitates dialogue, feedback, critical thinking, delegation, leadership and, ultimately, teamwork. This is also a process that gradually promotes flexibility, adaptive learning and confidence building to work with the kinds of interdependent and complex challenges of the social design briefs that students encounter in Designmatters studios. <br /><br />\n</p><p>3) Integration of the college\u2019s liberal arts curriculum into studio instruction. <br />\nDesignmatters trans-disciplinary studios expose students to broad-learning opportunities that are the hallmark of a vital 21st century liberal arts education, allowing them to connect their questions and concerns with a sense of ethical and civic responsibility and a critical understanding of the social issues that they are tackling. Depending on the nature of the design brief that is being addressed, domain experts from various fields of the social and hard sciences are invited as guest faculty and/or in advisory capacities to inform students\u2019 research and inquiry and prepare them to make relevant connections and apply this knowledge to their design ideation process.<br /><br />\n</p><p>III. In what way is this education\u00a0different from education for traditional creative disciplines?<br /><br />\n</p><p>The most singular and distinctive aspect of the educational model offered in the trans-disciplinary Designmatters studios is their human-centered and immersive quality\u2014one connected to the real-time/real-world framework of this experiential and project-based model of learning. Furthermore, because there is always an aspiration to collaborate with external partners to create novel and useful solutions that may be implemented after the educational engagement is over, students often receive training and support to incubate projects beyond the confines of the initial development of the project in the studio. <br /><br />\n</p><p>Since its inception in 2001, Designmatters has produced over 100 social innovation design projects, including print and multi-media campaigns, documentaries, public service announcements, educational toolkits, products, installations, and more. Over 90% of these projects have moved forward to real-world implementation by our strategic partners. In this way, Designmatters students are able to see their current work in action and recognize the positive impact their designs have on different levels of scale, from the local to the global.<br /><br />\n</p><p>IV. Include a student project as an example (of co-creation and collaboration)?<br />\n</p><p>In partnership with Coaniquem, a non-profit pediatric treatment facility in Santiago, Chile, that cares for young burn victims free of charge, the Spring 2016 Designmatters studio, SAFE Ni\u00f1os, challenged students to co-create with stakeholders to reinvigorate the 6-acre campus with engaging indoor and outdoor environments that would be welcoming and therapeutic for patients, their parents, and medical professionals. <br /><br />\n</p><p>Empathic co-creation was paramount to the success of SAFE Ni\u00f1os: the studio included multiple opportunities for students and faculty to conduct ethnographic research and field-testing in the setting of the clinic to ideate, prototype and validate design solutions. The basis for the studio syllabus was co-creation, with all decision making and learning happening in the form of carefully orchestrated opportunities for students to interact with patients and their families of Coaniquem as well as medical staff and incorporate experience-based insights to the ongoing creation and refinement of possible solutions. Observation, sense making and a wide array of participatory design research methods allowed students to develop concepts based on a reflective understanding of Coaniquem stakeholder\u2019s needs and aspirations.<br />\nStudents were inspired by the holistic nature of working together as a unified team for a common good, and they advocated to create one overriding concept with interconnected elements, featuring the students\u2019 individual talents.

Doing research on Santer\u00eda in Cuba made me more aware that I can use these rituals and adapt them in combination with traditional rituals from Cura\u00e7ao that I grew up with, to make sense of reality and to make sense of myself in a new location. This also in a way tells a story of my religious and spiritual life, or how spirituality plays a role in my life.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p><b>Background story</b>\nshort introduction of my fascination\n</p><p><br />\nMy fascination with supernatural things and rituals started when I was 15 and my grandma passed away, I tried to connect to her via an ouija board. This was my first attempt at trying to connect to something not tangible, something that we cannot see or touch. At that moment I truly believed that it was possible for me to connect to a different (Paranormal, magical, mystical, supernatural) world/frequency that wasn't the one we were living in. In contrast to this non catholic way to attempt to connect to this other world/ frequency, I have always felt obligated, to go to church (Catholic), and I perceived bible as a big book of myth. Some of the texts written in bible to me seems like fantasy.\nSince the first year of studying at the Willem de Kooning Academy, I have been doing a lot of research on colonialism as related to Cura\u00e7ao; specifically what is the stereotypical image of people from the Dutch Antilles in the media here in The Netherlands. While doing this research I came across video\u2019s, books and articles related to the use of Christianity, how it was used during slavery to tame or to create structure/Institutions (to manipulate/indoctrinate the enslaved people a certain way to get a specific result) in a society. And at the same time these former enslaved people were not allowed to practice their own beliefs. This resulted in syncretism (the fusion of diverse religious beliefs and practices) like the afro-Caribbean/ cuban belief, Santer\u00eda.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Brua in Cura\u00e7ao</b>\n</p><p>Believing in a magical practice is pretty common on the island of Cura\u00e7ao, but strangely enough it is still a taboo to talk about it openly (Blom, 2013). The majority of the population identify as Roman Catholic and/ or Christian (Groenewoud, 2013) but most of them beside being Catholic/Christian, also combine a few pagan rituals that are related to and come from a West African belief system, For example, the \u201cIf\u00e1\u201d religion from the Yoruba people from Nigeria. Every Afro-Caribbean (Santer\u00eda, Candomble, Vodum, 21 Divisiones, etc) practice that is not related to Catholicism or Christianity, is called \u201cBrua\u201d by the Christians/ Catholics in Cura\u00e7ao.\nBrua is an umbrella term for everything that can be considered pagan, for example witchcraft, superstitions, charlatanism, divination, etc. It can be used to do good and bad. Basically it has a negative connotation in this society, therefore the specialists do not call themselves hasid\u00f3 di brua, but trahad\u00f3 di misterio [mystery workers]. (Allen, 2010)\nSome of the pagan practices I grew up with were: using \u201cblous\u201d Reckitt\u2019s Crown Blue  and/or \u201cman pretu\u201d a black and gold necklace/pendant with the form of a fist, primarily as protection for babies against the evil eye (\u201coyada\u201d,\u201dMal de ojo\u201d or \u201cevil eye\u201d is a folk illness primarily affecting children, with infants being particularly vulnerable. This supernatural belief holds that an admiring look or a stare can weaken the child, leading to bad luck, sickness and even death.)\nHowever, Reckitt\u2019s Crown Blue is also being used on adults and around the house, as protection against bad energy.\n</p><p><b>Living and researching Santer\u00eda in</b>\nThe Netherlands\n</p><p><br />\nLiving in The Netherlands for almost 7 years has been really different and disconnected from what makes me feel good and grounded. In the Netherlands I feel as if everything happens behind closed doors, there are so many rules, people are more individualistic, and on the religious area most people that I talk to told me that they don\u2019t believe in anything. My reality shifted. This experience also opened my eyes to see \u201cBruheria\u201d in a total different way, because I started searching for ways to feel grounded and to feel more at home here. Most of these practices are non-Catholic rituals, like\nburning incense and candles, doing meditation and trying to connect to myself.\nLiving and going to school here and\nexploring my identity and spirituality, I notice that in the history of my island, religion plays\na big role in forming how people live there.\nThe conversion of Arawak Indians (natives from Cura\u00e7ao) to Catholicism, the transportation of the enslaved people from Africa with their own religion/belief and the imposition of christianity in the form of Catholicism on them (Lampe, 2001) was the reason why Cura\u00e7ao is so strongly a Catholic Island with a hint of hidden \u201cbruheria\u201d practices that everyone knows about, but won\u2019t talk about openly. We were taught from a young age that \u201cbrua\u201d is something diabolical and or warned that you have to be careful with it if you get involved with it. However, I feel like this is the same technique the colonizers used but by incorporating the bible and the word of god to manipulate/tricked our ancestors into believing that the religion that what they were doing and practicing is actually diabolical, and inferior compared to Catholicism. Catholicism was a superior version of a religion for the poor/enslaved peoples but Protestantism was the most superior religion (Lampe, 2001). Catherine Bell\u2019s (2009) ritual theory explains how colonizers (Dutches) have used their power as a tool for change and domination, that can also be considered as ritual. She describes ritualization: \u201cAt a basic level, ritualization is the production of this differentiation. At a more complex level, ritualization is a way of acting that specifically establishes a privileged contrast, differentiating itself as more important or powerful.\u201d\nThis definition, could be directly connected to religious rituals, in her book she also mentions: \u201cRitualization is the way to construct power relation when the power is claimed to be from God, not from military might or economic superiority; it is also the way for people to experience a vision of a community order that is personally empowering\u201d(Bell, 2009).\nThe video \u201cSavonet Museum Films_Santer\u00eda\u201d was the first video that introduce me to the afro-Caribbean/latin religion of Santer\u00eda on the island of Cura\u00e7ao. Santer\u00eda became something so fascinating to me that I started doing research on the relation between this and Christianity/Catholicism and the connection between the Catholic saint\u2019s and the Orishas. It appeared to be the main religion in Cuba, so my research took me there and I decided to go to Cuba to study this personally.\n</p><p><b>Field research in Cuba, Feb 2017</b>\n</p><p><br />\nThe research methods I used in Cuba were a mix of observing, walking round the city, talking informally to people about the culture and specifically the syncretism named Santer\u00eda, and participating in local ceremonies. Attending a few ceremony there I realized that Santer\u00eda is a way of living and it\u2019s part of the every day culture in Cuba. Everyone there knows about it, and everyone is involved in it one way or another. Just walking in the streets of Havana, I have seen a lot of offerings to specific Orisha, and there were a lot of people wearing \u201celeke\u201d colorful bracelets or necklaces, at that time I didn't know the significance of all the color.\nSanter\u00eda plays a big role in cuban politics. Politicians have consultations with santera/os to win battles against their rivals. For example: people interpreted something that happened during a speech Fidel Castro gave (Havana, cuba 8 January 1959) when a white dove landed on his shoulder, as a presence of the Orisha Obatala (the Orisha that created the world and humanity, the guide of every saints, syncretised as \u201cVirgen de las Mercedes\u201d).\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Ceremonies</b>\n</p><p><br />\nAt these different ceremonies that I visited, I always felt like I was part of it even though I didn't know any one. The ceremony was always accompanied by music and altars, and people were always dancing. At these moments I felt like I connected to something, but don't know how, I felt the need to move, dance, and so I did. The drum music lead the whole ceremony and the dancing of the person that get moved/mounted (I will use the word mounted, because it\u2019s the best way to translate the Spanish word \u201dmontar\u201d which is when a spirit takes over a persons body) by the spirit of ancestors. And the altar ( if looking at it from the perspective of someone that doesn't know anything of this belief it) looks like the decoration for a party/ ceremony. Many rituals I saw were repeated in all these ceremonies, and objects that were used for one ritual were also used for another ritual. There were also rituals with animal sacrifices and/or with food offerings. Rituals to cleanse yourself before entering a ceremony and divination rituals, some of them were very private that I was not allowed to be present in the room, because i was not a santera.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Walking around the city</b>\n</p><p><br />\nTo be more specific, Santer\u00eda is mixture of European Christianity, Spanish Catholicism, African Orisha worship from the Yoruba belief and French originated Kardecan spiritualism (de La Torre,2001). All of these practices come with a number of rituals that are being practiced during ceremonies and in everyday life. It was easy to spot or recognise some of these rituals, because they were actions that you see happening constantly, by the same groups of people. You also notice these people because they had specific dress code (initiators dress all in white for a year, all santeros had elekes), that symbolise a their connection to the Yoruba tradition in Cuba.\nOther ceremonies I visited used different kind of symbolic objects. These symbolic objects are simply everyday objects with a special arrangement or a special version. E.g. a table with seven glasses of water is something we can see in our daily life, but when you see these glasses on a table (La Boveda Espiritual: 7 glasses filled with water in a specific arrangement, the glass in the centre contain a metal crucifix, during a spiritism ceremony, you know that it has a totally different meaning, and that there is a specific way to act around this object. Another object that I have seen a lot was clay jars (tinaja) and soup bowls both with lids, these were filled with rocks (and other secretive substance) that were carefully picked by performing a ritualistic divining process with coconut shells or cowry shells. This process is the only way to know which rock is destined for this purpose. This filled jar/bowl represent the Orishas.\nWhen the normal purpose of such an object is everyday, their symbolic use is marked by prescribed, formalized action, so that the movements and gesture involved also become symbolic (Bull, Mitchell, 2016). Other objects and products that were frequently used in rituals during/on various other ceremonies/ altars were: Cascarilla (solidified eggshell powder mix), coconut, seashells, palm oil, statue of the orisha Elegu\u00e1 (the deity of the crossroads, he is also know as Saint Michael, Saint Anthony of Padua, or the Holy Child of Atocha in Catholicism) drums, herbs, flowers, metal crucifix, cigars, herbs, a\u00f1il (indigo), rum/ aguardiente etc. Most of these objects and products were made out of natural material. I was told that everything natural obtains \u201cAsh\u00e9\u201d, Ash\u00e9 is the power/energy to make things happen and make changes, it is also used similarly to the word amen/blessing.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Informal conversation</b>\n\n</p><p>During a few informal conversation I had with a few santera/os I was told of some rituals that needed to be practiced everyday, like taking off your eleke\u2019s: at night before going to sleep, during showers, and sexual activities. Saluting your Orisha in the morning is also a really significant ritual to do, because this will help you start your day on a good note, and it is also a way to show respect to your guardian angel/Orisha. Another ritual I observed being carried out/done daily by this santero (he had the Orisha Elegu\u00e1 crowned) before leaving his house, was doing a circular motion around his head with a machete, as a way to salute his Orisha Elegu\u00e1. People in Cuba and elsewhere believe rituals are a way to put our energy in tune with the energy that are in forces of/in nature (Teish, 2012). By doing these rituals every day you will feel spiritually more grounded, and more connected to nature on a personal level because Orisha\u2019s are the personification of nature\u2019s forces.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Ritual &amp; resistance</b>\n</p><p><br />\nAfter my visit to Cuba I noticed a lot of similarities between Santer\u00eda, and what we called Brua in Cura\u00e7ao even though Santer\u00eda would also be considered Brua. I was wondering even though Cura\u00e7ao and Cuba have a colonial past where Christianity was imposed on the enslaved people, why is it that the majority of the society of Cura\u00e7ao is Catholic, but in Cuba the majority is involved in many kinds of Afro-Cuban religion?\nThe reason why the majority of people on Cura\u00e7ao claim that they are Catholic, is because (Im going to use the theory of third space by Homi Bhabha) the African religions that the Enslaved people brought to Cura\u00e7ao/ Cuba which is the first space, was not allowed to be practiced, so the European imposes Christianity/Catholicism ( second space) upon the Africans, this resulted into Santer\u00eda and/or what we as Cura\u00e7aoans called Catholicism which is the third space, but I think this religion should be called Afro-Catholicism. In my opinion the Afro-Catholicism from Cura\u00e7ao is more based on what is written in the bible, it is less related to spirituality, but more to how you should behave as a respectable/decent person.The Catholicism that is practiced in Cura\u00e7ao was never a mere copy of African traditions nor of European culture (Lampe, 2001), This is the reason why I think that Cura\u00e7aoans call themselves Catholic, it was a way to hide their practice from the oppressor.\nThis adapted version of Catholicism was a form of resistance against the system in Cura\u00e7ao, and in Cuba Santer\u00eda was a form of resistance (de La Torre,2001). Santer\u00eda is more embedded in the culture and if you want to be part of it, that\u2019s your choice, and the most important thing to me is that it is more involved with the spirituality of a human being and how to make people feel good from the inside, and it is always executed with a group of people, and most are originated from our ancestors that came from the continent of Africa.\nA different form of resistance that was used in Cura\u00e7ao during the colonial period was:\n-\u201cTamb\u00fa\u201d. The word tamb\u00fa referred to the instrument, which is a drum, the music, and the dance. It is a traditional African custom. Even thought tamb\u00fa was prohibited during slavery, and was condemned by the Catholic church, it\u2019s still a ritual we practice, especially during the end of the year (Allen, 2007).\n-Using the storytelling of \u201cNanzi\u201d, the trickster spider the main character in these stories represent the enslaved people and the other character Shon (Shon, papiamentu word for slave master) Arei, referred to the slave master, this enabled the master-slave relationship to be shown and talked about within these stories. They were also a reflection of the enslaved people on the Catholic and African religious traditions, these stories spoke out against the slaves\u2019 situation (Lampe, 2001).\n-People also used Catholic saints as a cover for the Orishas. This was not only happening in Cura\u00e7ao, but mainly practiced in Santer\u00eda in Cuba. Santer\u00eda is basically a religion or resistance as these people were not allowed to practice their own beliefs/religion, and therefore they start using Catholic saints as a cover for their practice of African religious rituals and adoration of the Orishas. For example Yemaya is syncretized as \u201cLa virgen de la Regla\u201d, Elegu\u00e1 as \u201cSan Antonio\u201d, Oshun as \u201cLa Virgen de La Caridad del Cobre\u201d, etc. The rituals of Santer\u00eda were a critique of the dominant power structure. For example, a white decapitated dove found on the front step of the \u201cChristian\u201d slaveholder serve as a sign of forthcoming disaster (de La Torre,2001).\n</p><p><br />\n<b>A spiritism ceremony</b>\n</p><p><br />\nThe spiritism ceremony was the ceremony where I had the most intense experience regarding spirits taking over human bodies, because I have seen people get mounted by Orishas and Egguns (ancestor spirit), these people start acting exactly like the entity that has possessed them. The drum player is the one that leads the whole process. Tamb\u00fa (drum) party in Cura\u00e7ao is similar to the spiritism ceremony in Cuba, involving a group of people that collectively organised and/or participate at these event, except from the part where spirits mounted the people, this only happens in the spiritism ceremonies, and not in tamb\u00fa. Now they become a tradition that bring people together and/or form a community where you get a sense of belonging. The spiritism ceremony in Cuba involves a variety of rituals, the drum that were played was a way to call the spirits, when a spirit appear, someone will get mounted, the mounted person will react to the rhythm of the drum, the drummer will be the one that know if this person is faking a spirit possession or not, because he is the one who guide the ceremony at the moment. All of these rituals they were doing was a way to give something back to the participant and also a way to heal and help the person that has organized this ceremony. Dancing on the beat of the drum, as they told me, is also a ritual that helps dispose of all negative energy, and you will dance for the Orishas so that they can bless you. All of this is related to and comes from the past where our ancestors were using these kind of ceremony to release the stress of working on the plantation the whole day, because they were going through a lot, it was a sort of escapism.\n\u201cIf you perform an action repetitively with a desire result thats basically a ritual (Teish, 2012).\u201d This is how Lusiah Teish describe the word ritual, she also observes that rituals are practised in a sacred space. This is also a way to connect to the nature and your spiritual self. Rituals are things that you do as a routine, it involves the factor of time, and you do then in a specific space at a specific moment. I have already mentioned the Tamb\u00fa party, this party just like the spiritism ceremony in Cuba, involves dancing to release bad energy, but now it became a tradition to organise at the end of the year, so you can dance on the beat of the drums \u201ci kore ku fuku\u201d( get rid of bad spirit).\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Need to create ritual and how I apply them in an anti-ritual space</b>\n</p><p><br />\nMy urge to create rituals came primarily from a place of anger. Because I have noticed that Cura\u00e7ao Catholicism/Chritianity permeated every aspect of (free/enslaved) peoples life, e.g. their education, marriage, etc, and while talking to Cura\u00e7aoan living on the island, that a lot of them build their argument around bible verses especially when it comes to the subject of homosexuality. And to me this is the result of the education in schools that is also attached to Catholicism and our colonial past. This is the reason why I think that if we don't do research for ourselves we will never get to know our own history. School are the perfect institution to introduce these kind of subjects. Instead of focusing on the history of The Netherlands, start teaching about our own country and culture and also the idea that brua or any other pagan beliefs are not diabolic, primitive and/or ugly. People from Cura\u00e7ao are Catholic or Christian and most are not interested in talking about religion (I know that because I was one of them). So I would like to inform them in a way and/or change their perspective on why and how Catholicism/christianity was brought to Cura\u00e7ao.\nDuring LGBTQI pride in 2016, there were a lot of people and politicians criticising the movement/celebration and also a few flags that were placed on our really well known pontoon bridge (the Emma brug). The arguments that they were using to criticise this event, were purely based on bible passages, whilst the politician Marilyn Moses said that Pride is not part of our culture. Religion was most of the time argument against everything that is considered immoral according to the bible. Everything else was considered barbaric, or diabolic. And this is the why I connect christianity to the physical world, and beliefs like the Santer\u00eda to spirituality. Being born a certain gender doesn't have anything to do with who I like/ love, is only biological/physical. But the bible said that god create man and woman. While in the stories of the Orishas, you can see that in one story the Orisha/deity Obatala is represented as a male figure, and in another story they is a female. These two examples show that Christianity was built around the human, as physical bodies.A few text in the bible that refers to homosexuality as a sin and that heteronormativity is the norm are:\nLeviticus 20:13 - If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\nMatthew Chapter:19: verse:4-6&#160;:\n4 \u201cHaven\u2019t you read,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat at the\nbeginning the Creator \u2018made them male and female,\u2019\n5 and said, \u2018For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh\u2019?\n6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.\u201d\nMy need to create rituals and altar also came from my curiosity of playing with aspects of culture and religion while in a different space. Even though it is difficult to experience and comprehend rituals from another culture that is not yours, because you can misinterpret them, I did my best while I was in Cuba to get closer to the experience by observing and acting like they do, so there would be less friction between the space between me and them. That way I could understand more about what they were doing and what they were experiencing while e.g. dancing on the beat of the drum, or cleansing before entering a sacred space of ceremony.\nTrying to recreate these experience in a place where these thing are not common, was difficult for me to execute, due of the weather, and there are a lot of rules that you need to keep in mind before doing these kind of things. But doing my performance, installation \u201cIt\u2019s Like a Sickness\u201d, added something more natural/organic and colourful to the industrial landscape of Rotterdam.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>My practice</b>\n</p><p><br />\nThe seri \u2018Kuaresma\u2019 (Lent) is the last project I was working on. The word kuaresma derived from the latin word \u201cQuadragesima\u201d which means fortieth (cuarenta in Spanish). The fortieth, refers to several biblical verses, one of them symbolised the test which Jesus passed by staying in the desert for 40 days.\nIn lent it is a tradition for Catholic\u2019s to abstain and fast, I decided to challenge myself in the form of penitence by making a work a day. I created work that shows my dislike for the Catholic religion I grew up with, Mixed with elements of Santer\u00eda which became my area of interest and fascination. You can say that these works were a challenge to the critique Catholicism is always giving Santer\u00eda, or any other pagan practices. It also shows the way I deal with both practices in my work and in daily life. As it is difficult to let go of, as it (Catholic traditions) was part of my upbringing, and the other was there but not as vivid or acceptable.\nNot eating meat on Fridays during lent was one of the traditional rituals I grew up with, this is basically a Catholic ritual, but on the other hand, in this same period there were execution of superstitious/pagan rituals, for example if you get home after 00:00, you have to enter the house with your back, otherwise bad spirit/ energy will enter behind you. This was a way for me to spend the period of lent in my way, and at the same time I feel like this was the first time I did commit to something during this period, normally it\u2019s just like an obligation, and I don't feel comfortable to do it. But by combining art and a tradition I grow up with it made it easier for me to achieve this. Even though there were a few days when I didn't want to do anything, I still did the sacrifice of making something simple for that day. You can compare this challenge I did with the people that fast/abstain, pray and/or do charity during lent. I felt weak, frustrated, tired and even uninspired or without motivation to go on with what I was doing. And I did this for 40 consecutive days. Working like this gave me the opportunity to work with my frustration and to work against the period of lent with rituals that are not part of its tradition. I was able to explore my options in the form of art, and making rituals that takes my mind off the reality around me, and play around with my ideal form of spirituality, by combining the tradition I grew up with and Santer\u00eda.\nIn this seri I've used a lot of red and blue, the color red (and black) represent the Orisha Elegu\u00e1 which is the keeper of the crossroad between the real world and the spirit/magical world. And he is identified with the number 3, which is also the reason why most of my works are divided in 3 cause it represent the crossover/transition between the subject that plays a role in my works. Some time instead of using the color red, I will use catholic saints like Saint Anthony, or holy infant of Atocha, these are the variation of Elegu\u00e1 in Catholicism.\nThe blue stand for the blue product (blous) that we use a lot in Cura\u00e7ao for protection against evil eye. Blue also stands for my favourite Orisha Yemaya, which is the mother of all, the mother of the sea, she rules all the seven seas, so she is identified with the nr 7. In the works I have also used silver and the Catholic saint that represent Yemaya, which is Our Lady of the Rule. To me these Orishas are the two most important ones, because of their purpose. The objects I\u2019ve added to my works are also being used in Santer\u00eda rituals, but the statues of saints that I use are ways to represent the Orishas in a western way, because there are no specific human figure that represent the forces of nature. The only way you can get an image of these Orishas, is only if you use your imagination, because the patak\u00eds (story concerning the origins and interrelationships of the Orishas, as well as the role they play in determining the destiny of humanity (de La Torre,2001) of Orishas were only orally narrated.\nI have also made collages that documented experiences I had at different religious ceremonies in combination with landscape and products. An example is the work \u201cMi Eggun, Mi congo/a\u201d which was something a mounted woman told me about the image of my Eggun and how to treat him/her, and I made a portrait of this. Language is also something I use some times in my work, e.g. they have told me that I have \u201cUn negro congo\u201d as my Eggun, \u201cnegro\u201d is translated means Black, so I started using the black hand pendant as the hand of the ancestor in most of my work.\n</p><p><br />\n<i>Is not that we , the Cura\u00e7aoans don\u2019t know our language or our Gods, but we took what we were given and shaped it into something new...\u2029</i>\n\n</p><p><br />\n<b>References</b>\n</p><p><br />\n- Allen, Rose Mary. \u201cDi Ki Manera?: a Social History of Afro-Cura\u00e7aoans, 1863-1917.\u201d Amsterdam: SWP, 2007.\n- Allen, Rose Mary, HENDE A HASI MALU P\u2019E: POPULAR PSYCHIATRIC BELIEFS IN CURA\u00c7AOAN CULTURE, 2010.\n- Bell, Catherine M.

Migration, integration and multiculturalism come together in this vibrant part of the city, sometimes causing friction but also leading to wonderful collaborations and events. An example is the local community centre 'De Moza\u00efek'. Twice a week, in Resto VanHarte, people can enjoy a meal that is just as diverse as the neighbourhood's population. However, we found it striking that the majority of visitors is typically Dutch, quite in contrast with the kitchen team that seems to represent integration.

The production of clothing is aimed for increasing numbers and production to decrease prices. Low prices seem attractive, but what does this way of producing mean for the future of the environment and the people that work in this industry? The Post-Couture Collective offers an alternative to today\u2019s fashion system. It introduces a new era in the production of sustainable and affordable clothing. In our vision clothing is designed on the principles of open-source, and is made using 21st century technology.

Do \u201cembedded research\u201d, \u201cbuild real relationships with stakeholders\u201d, \u201cco-create with diverse groups\u201d, \u201ccreatively embrace the chaos of complex social issues\u201d, and so on. Since these expectations are so clearly laid out for students, the next logical step should be to discuss how teachers of the Social Practices can embody the same principles in their didactic practice. Teachers are not only accountable for their content, but also how they position themselves as tutors within the Social Practice. In this co-written article, we combine our experiences as a teacher and a student in the Social Practices to discuss how some simple notions could change the dynamic of educating within the complex context of social design.\nWe\u2019ve taken excerpts from four articles written on the Beyond Social Wiki and altered them slightly (changing the word \u2018students\u2019 to \u2018teachers\u2019 and \u2018target group/citizens\u2019 to \u2018students\u2019) to see what it would be like if we already practised what we teach.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p><small>By Lily Higgins and Bruno Setola</small><br /><br />\n</p><p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Design_Anthropology.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Design Anthropology.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/images/2/28/Design_Anthropology.jpg\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Embedded_Research\">Embedded Research</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Playtest_at_Leeszaal_with_locals.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Playtest at Leeszaal with locals.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/images/3/34/Playtest_at_Leeszaal_with_locals.jpg\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\" /></a>\n</p><p>Embedded research is an important part of the creative process of any social designer. But what about the idea of \u201cembedded teaching?\u201d. Embedded teaching would mean that teachers take an active, engaged role in the context their students are working in, acting as a bridge of trust between them and the context by building long-term relationships with local leaders over multiple school-years. Creating social projects within the constraints of the \u201cQuarter\u201d system means that building credible bonds of trust with a neighbourhood or group of people becomes a nearly impossible expectation for students (especially international, non-Dutch speaking ones). Starting in an unfamiliar context as an outsider with the title \u201cStudent\u201d is a recipe for not being taken seriously, and to subsequently spend the short weeks of the project solely trying to find something or someone to expedite the process of becoming an insider. We use high-level social design terminology in the classroom and show examples of social-design professionals, but how can we create a realistic way for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year students to simply get started? \n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd> <span style=\"font-family:Helvetica;\"> <small> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://beyond-social.org/wiki/index.php/MYNEWPAGE\">Excerpt from article on Sustainability:</a> Sometimes <i>teachers</i> can get overwhelmed and discouraged; the systemic approach risks making a educational programme more abstract which makes it more difficult to offer <i>guidance</i>. Therefore it is important they link newly required knowledge back to the reality of everyday <i>teaching</i>, to apply it to a <i>class'.</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<p></small>\n</p><p>One approach is to be a teacher who is already personally embedded in the context that their students are working in. New students will transition in and out of this context every few months, but the bridge of trust built by the teacher will remain. When a teacher demonstrates that they are personally invested in the design-context, students are encouraged to seek their own connections and create more meaningful work.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Safety\">Safety</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Lily_at_Central_Station.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Lily at Central Station.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/03/Lily_at_Central_Station.jpg\" width=\"3120\" height=\"4160\" /></a>\n</p><p>It is the role of the teacher to create a safe environment in which to learn, grow, and fail; if that is not the goal, then it cannot be considered school. Then it\u2019s just \u201cthe real world\u201d. Even though an essential part of the Social Practices is to work in real contexts, by definition, it is not the same. School should offer a safe learning environment. It is a place for students to experiment without the fear of losing jobs or other consequences that could cause real damage in the real-world. \n</p><p>This safety net gives young social designers the chance to come face-to-face with real-world problems, develop real creative interventions in them, and come into contact with the real ethics that arise as a result of their work; without their missteps or failed experiments leading to repercussions. If this safety net is not firmly in place, then why bother going to school at all? Just go out on your own and start messing around in other people\u2019s neighbourhoods. In order to set students up for meaningful learning experiences, it is critical that teachers provide the bridge and safety net needed for students to get straight to the heart of being able to apply their theoretical social design knowledge. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intrinsic_Motivation\">Intrinsic Motivation</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Students_working_on_research_location.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Students working on research location.jpg\" src=\"/wiki/images/e/ec/Students_working_on_research_location.jpg\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n</p><p>We believe that the essence of the social practices should be taught in a way that triggers, promotes, and supports the intrinsic motivation of students. This would mean that teachers should initially frame projects as a way to extrinsically motivate students; build a bridge to a real-life context and present a clearly defined challenge within that context that should be explored. Some students will be happy to complete the assignment as the teacher originally laid-out, but some will discover something on the way that strikes their intrinsic motivation. In other words, we propose to use the initial challenge as an open scaffolding to allow for a student to discover his or her intrinsic motivation. \n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd> <span style=\"font-family:Helvetica;\"> <small> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://beyond-social.org/wiki/index.php/Why_Gamification%3F\">Excerpt from article on Gamification:</a> With Gamification we seek to empower (underprivileged) <i>students</i> to understand, challenge and change the rules that govern their <i>education</i> and <i>way of learning</i> through play. We encourage our <i>teachers</i> and <i>students</i> to adopt a playful attitude in order to get back in touch with what intrinsically motivates them in <i>learning</i>. It is the 'experience' and, most importantly, the reflection on this experience that is at the heart of our didactics. This enables a change in mindset, awareness and behaviour.</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<p></small>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd> <span style=\"font-family:Helvetica;\"> <small> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://beyond-social.org/wiki/index.php/The_Significance_Of_Signature\">Excerpt from article on Open Design:</a> <i>Designing a curriculum</i> for \u2018openness\u2019, participation or teacher appropriation opens up questions regarding <i>WdKA\u2019s</i> \u2018signature\u2019 and the space for experimentation. <i>Designing a curriculum</i> for this kind of uncertainty is often associated with giving up control. Within this context, and because the WdKA hires <i>professionals</i> (rather than social workers or administrators), we explicitly investigate the often overlooked <i>didactic</i> perspective. The programme\u2019s questions include: what is openness in <i>didactics</i>? Can an open <i>lesson</i> or <i>learning</i> process leave room for expression by both <i>teacher</i> and <i>student</i>? What are <i>didactic</i> participatory strategies within the context of sharing, participation and iteration?</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<p></small>\n</p><p>As long as the newly defined challenge of the student fits the generic learning goals that the tutor has defined, we should give \u201cright of way\u201d to any alternate challenge that emerges and be willing to toss the original practical constraints aside, as they served their purpose of sparking independently-motivated learning! Supporting a student beyond the boundaries of the assignment is therefore the second \u2018bridge\u2019 a teacher is responsible for building; the one that gives a student pursuing their own path the same level of guidance, support, and valuable connections within a context as those who followed the original project guidelines. The role of the teacher is not to uphold constraints, it is to create an environment where many different types of students can thrive, whether they play by the \u201crules\u201d or not. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Off-road_Learning\">Off-road Learning</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/b/b0/Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg/600px-Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/thumb/b/b0/Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg/900px-Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/images/thumb/b/b0/Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg/1200px-Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Final_demo_of_the_game_with_partner_organisation_DelfsHaven_Cooperatie.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Final demo of the game with partner organisation DelfsHaven Cooperatie</div></div></div>\n<p>A small anecdote by Bruno: \u2018This year in the Gamification Minor, there was a group of students who got stuck on their project in the middle of the semester and came to me with the concern that they wouldn\u2019t be able to produce a finished game by the deadline we set with the client. I saw they they were motivated, but that the \u201crules\u201d of the project brief were keeping them from moving forward. They were struggling to find a connection to the neighbourhood they were assigned to work with and the fear of not developing a finished game within that context froze their process. When I realised this, I told them that it was okay to see the project guidelines as flexible and that it was okay if they didn\u2019t end up developing a finished game. As long as they were able to show me what they had learned in the end, I promised I would not fail them for this. As soon as they understood this, their creative process gained speed again and they pursued their interests through intrinsic motivation. In the end, they did design a game that was directly aligned with the needs of the client and the neighbourhood in question. Furthermore, the game was rigorously tested to prove it\u2019s playability. All because they stopped following the briefing, and started following their gut.\u2019\n</p><p>So, are teachers willing to let students go \u2018off-road\u2019? And more importantly, are they willing to go off-road with them? Going off-road together creates the ideal conditions to establish a Learning Community, where teachers and students abandon the traditional didactic hierarchy to exchange insights and experiences from their own design practices. Teachers in the Social Practice are then expected to practice improvisational approaches in order to guide students through unexpected challenges that might be unfamiliar to all involved. Are teachers willing to put aside their didactic egos and admit what they don\u2019t know, while taking an active role to learn along the way? \n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd> <span style=\"font-family:Helvetica;\"> <small> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://beyond-social.org/wiki/index.php/Embed_Yourself\">Excerpt from article on Cultural Diversity:</a> What we at the WdKA call Social Practices is far removed from the isolation and independence of the <i>lecturer\u2019s classroom</i>.

Something that is not accepted in that culture.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p>author: Maud Dik\n</p><p>\u201cHwages\u201d or in English, \u201c Concerns\u201d.<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38520492\">[1]</a> Was Posted on Youtube December 23th. The video is created by media production company 8ies. The video has around 7 million views since it has been uploaded on Youtube.  \nWhat is so special about this videoclip?  The videoclip has been made by a Saudi Arabia located company, this is not weird or special. What special is, is that the content in the videoclip highlights the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia. Something that is not accepted in that culture. Neither is that women drive, swim in public pools, work out in gyms, enter cemeteries, browse fashion magazines, open their own bank account, file for divorce, wear anything other than an abaya in public, and so on. Women aren\u2019t aloud to do much in that country. Yet all these things that I just named are the things this video clip makes fun of.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hwages-8IES\">Hwages-8IES</span></h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/irl/saudi-women-break-stereotypes-music-video/\">[2]</a>.\n</p>\n<div class='embedvideo autoResize' style=''><div class='embedvideowrap' style='width: 640px;'><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1rUn2j1hLOo?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>\ufffc\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"About_the_videoclip\">About the videoclip</span></h3>\n<p>The women are playing basketball, skating, breaking out in dance, and rinding in some bumper cars. The only men that are featured in this video clip are the driver, which is a little boy, two disapproving official types and a Donald Trump cutout <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/womens-rights-saudi-arabia-viral-feminist-pop-song-music-video-calls-end-men-watch-2468707\">[3]</a>. By showing these men in the video, they show how ridiculous the rights are for women. They show that even a little boy has more rights by let him driving the car but women don\u2019t. Donald Trump is in the video probably because these days he is strict on women rights and cuts them down. The producers want to show that there are similarities in the way trump thinks about women and the way Saudi Arabia think of women. \nThe lyrics that is sung in the clip can be translated to \u201c May all men be erased as they\u2019ve given us mental illness\u201d and \u201c If only God would rid us of men\u201d. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/04/middleeast/saudi-song-women/\">[4]</a> These are some confronting sentences but are a good and direct way of letting people, especially in their home country , know how sick and tired they are of the male-dominated society in Saudi Arabia. it expresses women\u2019s frustration. Something i really like about this clip.  It may be controversial but it shows the direct messages and you can\u2019t look away from it. you can\u2019t also interpret it differently. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Opinions\">Opinions</span></h4>\n<p>By the controversiality of this videoclip there are also a lot of people whom have an opinion on this project. The reactions are very diverse if you look at the comments on the Youtube page. They differ from \"The video clip is beautiful. With all the comedy, it shows one aspect of oppression girls are subjected to.\" to \"Unbelievable video clip!! The voice is bad and the content is worse.. Imagine the girls drive (cars) and men are dressed like that and dance. May Allah protect us.\" but also \"Foreign newspapers are mentioning it. Creatives - let the world know that there are talented people who appreciate art in Saudi Arabia. It is not all about religious police, clerics IS members and retardation.\"\n</p><p>The diversity of these comments is something i really like about this project. People start talking about it, it starts a cultural discussion without intention. \n</p><p>It has been produced and created only by men, so when i first found out I kind of thought it was weird. In a country where the men has so many rights and power. why would they make something so specific critical on those rights and powers they posses. The only thing 8ies studio co founder wanted to say about this production is \"We are a creative company that produces entertainment videos through social media platforms.\u201d<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.8iess.com\">[5]</a> I don\u2019t know if they intended to make such a controversial entertainment video but I think the fact that it are men whom made this,  fully contributes to the message that it publicize. \n</p>\nI think it is a good social project because (intended or not intended) they take a social and political problem that apply for their country&#160;: male-dominance. By showing what women can do and making fun of the fact that they can\u2019t because of men they create new images and a new narrative. They create a visual that shows how it could be. How they do this is very professional. they show it by the visuals but also with the songtekst. they have thought of the many sides of a videoclip and how it could communicate best. They could have chosen for images of women but instead they use \u201creal life\u201d women who are acting in the activities.</div>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Links\">Links</span><span

The video is created by media production company 8ies. The video has around 7 million views since it has been uploaded on Youtube.  \nWhat is so special about this videoclip?  The videoclip has been made by a Saudi Arabia located company, this is not weird or special. What special is, is that the content in the videoclip highlights the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia. Something that is not accepted in that culture. neither is that women drive, swim in public pools, work out in gyms, enter cemeteries, browse fashion magazines, open their own bank account, file for divorce, wear anything other than an abaya in public, and so on. Women aren\u2019t aloud to do much in that country. Yet all these things that I just named are the things this video clip makes fun of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/irl/saudi-women-break-stereotypes-music-video/\">[7]</a>.\n</p>\n<div class='embedvideo autoResize' style=''><div class='embedvideowrap' style='width: 640px;'><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1rUn2j1hLOo?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>\ufffc\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"About_the_videoclip_2\">About the videoclip</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Hwages_review&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: About the videoclip\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The women are playing basketball, skating, breaking out in dance, and rinding in some bumper cars. The only men that are featured in this video clip are the driver, which is a little boy, two disapproving official types and a Donald Trump cutout <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/womens-rights-saudi-arabia-viral-feminist-pop-song-music-video-calls-end-men-watch-2468707\">[8]</a>. By showing these men in the video, they show how ridiculous the rights are for women. They show that even a little boy has more rights by let him driving the car but women don\u2019t. Donald Trump is in the video probably because these days he is strict on women rights and cuts them down. The producers want to show that there are similarities in the way trump thinks about women and the way Saudi Arabia think of women. \nThe lyrics that is sung in the clip can be translated to \u201c May all men be erased as they\u2019ve given us mental illness\u201d and \u201c If only God would rid us of men\u201d. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/04/middleeast/saudi-song-women/\">[9]</a> These are some confronting sentences but are a good and direct way of letting people, especially in their home country , know how sick and tired they are of the male-dominated society in Saudi Arabia. it expresses women\u2019s frustration. Something i really like about this clip.  It may be controversial but it shows the direct messages and you can\u2019t look away from it. you can\u2019t also interpret it differently. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Opinions_2\">Opinions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Hwages_review&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Opinions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>By the controversiality of this videoclip there are also a lot of people whom have an opinion on this project. The reactions are very diverse if you look at the comments on the Youtube page. They differ from \"The video clip is beautiful. With all the comedy, it shows one aspect of oppression girls are subjected to.\" to \"Unbelievable video clip!! The voice is bad and the content is worse.. Imagine the girls drive (cars) and men are dressed like that and dance. May Allah protect us.\" but also \"Foreign newspapers are mentioning it. Creatives - let the world know that there are talented people who appreciate art in Saudi Arabia. It is not all about religious police, clerics IS members and retardation.\"\n</p><p>The diversity of these comments is something i really like about this project. People start talking about it, it starts a cultural discussion without intention. \n</p><p>It has been produced and created only by men, so when i first found out I kind of thought it was weird. In a country where the men has so many rights and power. why would they make something so specific critical on those rights and powers they posses. The only thing 8ies studio co founder wanted to say about this production is \"We are a creative company that produces entertainment videos through social media platforms.\u201d<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.8iess.com\">[10]</a> I don\u2019t know if they intended to make such a controversial entertainment video but I think the fact that it are men whom made this,  fully contributes to the message that it publicize. \n</p><p>I think it is a good social project because (intended or not intended) they take a social and political problem that apply for their country&#160;: male-dominance. By showing what women can do and making fun of the fact that they can\u2019t because of men they create new images and a new narrative. They create a visual that shows how it could be. How they do this is very professional. they show it by the visuals but also with the songtekst. they have thought of the many sides of a videoclip and how it could communicate best. They could have chosen for images of women but instead they use \u201creal life\u201d women who are acting in the activities.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20181012094151\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\n[SMW] In\u2010text annotation parser time: 0.003 seconds\nCPU time usage: 0.054 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.084 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 373/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 1243/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 19061/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 6774/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   41.770      1 -total\n 93.42%   39.021      1 Template:Articles_more\n  5.69%    2.375     10 Template:Articles\n  3.56%    1.488      1 Template:Contribute\n  3.28%    1.369      1 Template:Article\n  2.56%    1.068      5 Template:Category_selector\n-->\n",

How can social art and design contribute to this effort? Which concrete social art and design practices will be we able to realise? With whom and for whom? These questions are at the core of the multi-year programme \u2018Line 23\u2019 which is being implemented in three neighbourhoods of Rotterdam. The programme is an initiative of the department of Social Art and Design at the Willem de Kooning Academy (WdKA) in Rotterdam, in collaboration with an expanding learning community of civic and professional partners, in the city and far beyond, who share some of the same questions and ambitions. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beyond_Social_as_a_learning_community\">Beyond Social as a learning community</span></h2>\n<p>Beyond Social serves as a platform for sharing thoughts, experiences and the results of this programme, both within the learning community and with a wider audience. Everyone is invited to publish in this wiki and to join our events. The focus of this editorial is to promote interaction and to assist you in finding your way within our various activities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"City_of_contrasts\">City of contrasts</span></h2>\n<p>Rotterdam may rightly call itself a metropolis. The underdog with its residents of countless nationalities seems to always be reinventing itself. The city\u2019s dynamism has been noted far beyond the country\u2019s borders. But how is this experienced within the city itself? Which prospects does this dynamism actually provide to its residents? Optimistically inclined Rotterdammers have traditionally described the DNA of their city as \u2018entrepreneurial\u2019, \u2018raw\u2019 and \u2018international\u2019. The city now boldly positions itself as a frontrunner of the \u2018next economy\u2019. Others however see a completely different picture: for them, Rotterdam is still the city where \u2018urban problems\u2019 can be written in capital letters, with a grim reality of inequality and exclusion \u2013 particularly for the younger, culturally diverse generation. Like many other metropolises, Rotterdam is thus a city of contrasts. Both perspectives are true. But are they also compatible?\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_an_inclusive_city.3F\">Why an inclusive city?</span></h2>\n<p>Is an inclusive development of the city even possible? And why is this something we should want to invest in? What is the underlying context? What are the challenges? We have been exploring local, international, individual and public perceptions, policies and strategies of how and why to aim for inclusivity in our society and in a metropolis such as Rotterdam. Interesting references include a recent World Bank study on inclusive cities, the Rotterdam municipal government\u2019s own Urban Agenda, and of course the strategies of our local partners and their international networks. We invite experts in the field, as well as students, citizens, artists and scientists to reflect upon this theme. In Beyond Social you will find contributions by experts such as the artist Quincy Gario and the political philosopher Tina Rahimy, alongside a number of design fictions proposed by WdKA students.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_to_become_a_.E2.80.98game_changer.E2.80.99\">How to become a \u2018game changer\u2019</span></h2>\n<p>Will the new generation of creative entrepreneurs be in a position to contribute to an inclusive development of the city? How can an art and design academy such as the WdKA contribute to this development as optimally as possible? In order to find answers to these questions, we are currently exploring a variety of approaches and positions in the field of social art and design. How does it work? Why does it work? We are also well aware that it is far from obvious to combine on one hand the educational objectives and requirements of an art and design academy and its students, and on the other hand the urgency of the communities and local partners in dealing effectively with today\u2019s far-reaching transitions and \u2018wicked\u2019 social problems. However, to us, refraining from active engagement is simply not an option. Therefore we must find ways of optimising the relationship between education and practice in a long-term relationship \u2013 combining action and learning in the best possible way. This quest was the starting point of a Community of Practice which we have now called \u2018Line 23\u2019.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Community_of_Practice_.E2.80.98Line_23.E2.80.99\">Community of Practice \u2018Line 23\u2019</span></h2>\n<p>The multi-year programme \u2018Line 23\u2019 was launched in 2016 in three Rotterdam neighbourhoods. Our aim is to contribute to the realisation of an inclusive city, while at the same time continuing to learn how to do so as effectively as possible. The programme is being implemented in the neighbourhoods Bospolder-Tussendijken / Merwe-Vierhavens (Delfshaven district), Afrikaanderwijk (Feijenoord district) and Beverwaard (IJsselmonde district), in collaboration with local partners such as CultuurConcreet, Bouwkeet, Delfshaven Co\u00f6peratie, Bibliotheek Rotterdam, Freehouse, Afrikaanderwijk Co\u00f6peratie, Veldacademie, IJsselwijs, and the Erasmus University Medical Center, with whom we are addressing various issues related to the social DNA of these neighbourhoods and experimenting with \u2018inclusive\u2019 approaches to the \u2018next economy\u2019, gentrification, and promoting healthy lifestyles. The name \u2018Line 23\u2019 refers to tram line 23 which crosses through Rotterdam from Northwest to Southeast, from Delfshaven to Beverwaard, thus connecting the three districts involved. Line 23 is also known as one of the longest tram lines in the Netherlands. Our Community of Practice explicitly identifies with these notions of traversing and connecting the city, and of opting for the long range. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_are_the_first_results.3F\">What are the first results?</span></h2>\n<p>Bouwkeet opened its doors during the second half of 2016, with the ambition to foster the \u201821st-century skills\u2019 of youngsters in Bospolder-Tussendijken. Afrikaanderwijk Co\u00f6peratie was awarded the \u2018right to challenge\u2019 the waste problems and opportunities of the Afrikaanderplein street market. IJsselwijs, with the support of Veldacademie, launched an ambitious pilot project addressing the serious obesity issues of youngsters in Beverwaard. Approximately 70 third-year students and some 10 lecturers of the Social Design department have joined these and other similar initiatives, with the aim of offering a positive contribution to their success. We intend to continue these efforts in 2017, 2018 and onward. The first results of our Community of Practice are being published in this wiki, and presented and discussed at the Beyond Social Event on February 9, 2017, where a number of experts and students involved will share their experiences. Below you can find more information about this event, as well as links to relevant articles and contributions. This is only the beginning of a multi-year programme of action and learning. You are cordially invited to join us.\n</p>\n</div>  \n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Selected_articles\">Selected articles</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span

That means I got to enjoy amazing Dominican \u2018mang\u00fa\u2019 and \u2018s\u00f2pi di kabritu\u2019 from Cura\u00e7ao almost every weekend. It also meant growing up with difficulties in feeling I could be myself without having to assimilate, in order to fit in with the people around me. As I got older, I discovered my own sexual orientation as an attempt to classify it, same as I wanted to classify/pigeonhole my racial background. \n</p><p>Could I live life as a half-Dominican in Curacao? What side of my identity should I choose? As if I was only allowed to choose one over the other, sticking to the stereotypes of what it means to be Cura\u00e7aoan or Dominican. As the son of a Dominican and Cura\u00e7aoan, I found myself having a similar way of approaching my sexual orientation. I thought I\u2019d have to choose between living life as a heterosexual or as a covert homosexual. Knowing very well that I thought that I would not have the courage to step up and confess my sexuality unless I\u2019d move to another country or both my parents passed away. I began to internalize the heterosexism that was taught in my household.  My self-worth began to become as absent as my sense of identity. \n</p><p>I\u2019ve encountered many queer people of color whom share a similar story as mine. Parents usually react by feeling angry and ashamed, afraid of what others in the community are going to say and think. The church also plays a great part in what, more often than not, will be used as a backbone argument to declare queer sexuality sinful. It\u2019s also not just about the coming out part but about moving forward after coming out, about how this milestone that supposedly sets you free isn\u2019t a singular moment in your lifespan but a continuous struggle. In the view of intersectionality, there is a complex layering that makes queerness of color completely different from the white queer experience, specifically in The Netherlands. \n</p><p>\u201cI think white gay people feel cheated because they were born, in principle, in a society in which they were supposed to be safe. The anomaly of their sexuality puts them in danger, unexpectedly. Their reaction seems to me in direct proportion to their sense of feeling cheated of the advantages, which accrue to white people in a white society. There\u2019s an element, it has always seemed to me, of bewilderment and complaint. Now that may sound very harsh, but the gay world as such is no more prepared to accept black people than anywhere else in society. It\u2019s a very hermetically sealed world with very unattractive features, including racism.\u201d\n</p><p>Go the Way Your Blood Beats (Interview with James Baldwin)\nRichard Goldstein\nVoice, 1984\n</p><p>\u201cNaar mijn ervaringen met zowel witte hetero mensen als niet-hetero mensen, verwacht ik geen verschil tussen de hoeveelheid racisme. Ik verwacht wel verschil in de manier waarop racisme tot uiting komt. Er bestaat namelijk (nog) geen sterke broeder/zusterschap die queer mensen, ongeacht etnische afkomst, verbindt.  De loyaliteit ligt vaak elders. \n</p><p>Ik zal altijd zwart zijn, voordat ik als queer word gezien. Ook binnen de homogemeenschap. De invulling van wat zwart betekent voor een niet-zwart queer persoon, heeft gevolgen voor hoe zwarte queer mensen worden behandeld.\u201d\n</p><p>Translation: In my experiences with both white straight people and non-heterosexual people, I do not expect a difference between the amount of racism. I do expect a difference in the way racism is expressed. There is not (yet) a strong brother / sisterhood that connects queer people, regardless of ethnic origin. Loyalty is often elsewhere.\n</p><p>I will always be black before I am seen as queer. Also within the gay community. The interpretation of what black means for a non-black queer person has consequences for how black queer people are treated.\"\n</p><p>Blog entry by Abdi Suleiman (January 17, 2018)\nZwart en Queer in Nederland\n</p><p>Despite their violence, I appreciate all the intersections of oppression and exclusion that I have experienced. They have helped me to become compassionate.\n</p><p>I position myself as an Afro-Caribbean queer male artist in search of the queer history and lived experience of Cura\u00e7aoan people in The Netherlands. I will use the word queer in this document and in my work because of the historical weight it carries, which I will explain a little bit more later on. Also, because it\u2019s a term that recognizes male, female, non-binary and gender non-conforming and trans lives.\n</p><p>For us\u2014queer Cura\u00e7aoans in the Netherlands\u2014I believe, it\u2019s important to work on preserving, investigating, and making visible our queer past both in the once-colonized and former-colonizer landscapes.\n</p><p><i>DISCARDED NOTE: Recognizing our position within the queer community in The Netherlands, the past achievements of the stories told as part of the movement towards better representation.</i> \n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Both_hands_one_belly.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Both hands one belly.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/3/38/Both_hands_one_belly.gif\" width=\"720\" height=\"576\" /></a></div></div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"III.29.09_POWER_OF_ORAL_HISTORIES_AND_NARRATIVES\">III)\t POWER OF ORAL HISTORIES AND NARRATIVES</span></h3>\n<p>I was curious to find out more about the gay liberation movement that had started in late 19th century Netherlands, as it was one of the earliest points in history where the queer community collectively fought for equal rights and against (legal) discrimination.  Before this process began, homosexuality was seen as sodomy and punishable by law in Europe since the 13th century. \n</p><p>My first step into the field research was to find queer people of color in The Netherlands who had experienced the Gay Liberation movement first hand here. \n</p><p>There was no documentation I could easily access or knew where to find in the places where I was looking\u2014Jstor, libraries in Rotterdam, online via Google search. What I did find were queer or black writers from the Netherlands, but none writing about the Afro-Caribbean history and experience. It became clear to me that I had to find people of color who were here during that time and had some sort of involvement with the liberation movement. I had to meet people who were willing to share their stories with me. In other words, I had to learn (by doing) how to collect oral narratives of past events and time periods. \n</p><p>Oral tradition was a critical tool for preservation of stories that would otherwise be lost from one generation to another, especially in precarious, underserved, at risk, or militant communities. Two quotes from sociologist Paul Thompson in The Voice of the Past Oral History:\n</p><p>\u201cMining and fishing communities are the classic subjects of this type of work.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cOther historians have recorded life-stories with radical activists, ranging from British socialists to African Peasant Intellectuals. And in general, oral evidence can provide much missing information on the activities and attitudes of the rank and file of the parties: their reading, their social backgrounds and occupations and relationships.\u201d\n</p><p>In an attempt to better understand what led to the start of the liberation movement in the late 1960s, then unified under term \u2018gay\u2019, I read the book Pijlen van naamloze liefde: Pioniers van de homo-emancipatie (Maurice Van Lieshout and Hans Hafkamp, 1988). While it extensively discussed the process of decriminalization for homosexuality during the late 19th century, it was only a vast collection of white actors who were given recognition as \u2018pioneers\u2019 in the book. Patrick Reinsborough and Doyle Canning wrote in about their understanding of the use of narratives to move people by creating bonds of mutual understanding. \n</p><p>\u201cNarrative power analysis is based on the recognition that the currency of story is not truth, but meaning. That is, what makes a story powerful is not necessarily facts but how the story creates meaning in the hearts and minds of the listeners.\u201d\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Felix.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Felix.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/e/e2/Felix.gif\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></a></div></div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"IV.29.09THREE_INTERVIEWS\">IV)\tTHREE INTERVIEWS</span></h3>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ethnographic_field_notes.2C_by_chapter_and_in_reverse_chronological_order\">Ethnographic field notes, by chapter and in reverse chronological order</span></h5>\n<p>The interviews are spoken in Dutch-Papiamentu or completely in Papiamentu. These recorded conversations do not include introductions or conclusions. They are long captured moments. I chose to do this to create an intimate and trusted relationship with them.\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kapitulo_Unu\">Kapitulo Unu</span></h5>\n<p>Felix de Rooy (1952)\n</p><p>Felix de Rooy was someone I got to know through Glenn Helberg. Glenn was very proud of Felix and his achievements both here in The Netherlands and back home in Cura\u00e7ao. I had arranged a meeting with him on Sunday in Amsterdam; he was the second person I was going to interview for this project. I had rented a camera, mic and tripod to set up at his home, where he was kind enough to invite me over for our talk. As walked through the doorway, he greeted me at the top of the stairs. I could barely see him in the darkness, couldn\u2019t see what he was wearing. It was unsettling. He said one word. \u201cCome.\u201d And I did. As I walked into his apartment I immediately a feeling come over that this man was going to have a great impact on me. Before I could even start recording, he had already summarized his childhood experience on the island. And I couldn\u2019t dare to stop him as he had a way of telling his story that felt unapologetic. He was secure about himself. Even though he has won many awards\u2014for theater work, directing and writing movies\u2014I realized I had not heard of him while growing up in Cura\u00e7ao. I must say, my family wasn\u2019t much supportive of the arts of any kind back then, so we weren\u2019t part of any \u201cbougie\u201d circles that knew who he was. But he was an important staple in the theater and film scene on the island.\n</p><p>But then, another thought came up to me. Most successful or talented queer people from Cura\u00e7ao are not that visible or audible (spoken about in public). Those who are most of the times are made fun of, because they also act comically. They might also be transgender but still classified or seen as gay. \n</p><p>I got to know that he was very encouraged to explore the arts from an early age by his parents, who were also art enthusiasts, and with that he developed a talent for speaking his mind. I really admired how he put his experiences as a queer man from Cura\u00e7ao into his work . He wrote a theater play, Marival, around understanding the playful performativity of island drag queens. One of the things that stayed with me after this conversation was how he experienced going back to Cura\u00e7ao after living in The Netherlands a couple of years. He returned to teach at a high school on the island. The first day of school, he was quickly made aware of how bizarre and mariku his outfit was by the students who had watched him pass by. He recalls that he actually had worn a very \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019 inspired outfit, boots and all. He turned around on his pirate heels. To the group of boys who were still laughing, he said, in a very unsympathetic tone of voice, \u201cYes that\u2019s right, I am gay. And I know that this won\u2019t be a problem for us, will it?\u201d This had an impact on the students. His response made it clear that he didn\u2019t really care about being outed or even about being called mariku. He was in control, not ashamed of his sexuality. He became one of the teachers students came to if they wanted to understand about not just sexuality but also things like art or the world beyond the borders of Cura\u00e7ao. I left, after spending almost the whole day there, feeling like I found a piece of history that I was supposed to know but never knew existed.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kapitulo_Dos\">Kapitulo Dos</span></h5>\n<p>Glenn Helberg (1955)\n</p><p>Psychiatrist Glenn Helberg is a well-known activist from Cura\u00e7ao. He was also one very important contact person for me during this search. \n</p><p>Meeting with Glenn was a bit difficult because of his busy agenda. We often ended having unplanned conversations through the phone while he rushed to a meeting or sat in a train on his way to the Tropen Museum. We ultimately arranged a meeting at his apartment in Amsterdam. We had to move things along quickly as he had another appointment planned right after ours. I asked him first about how his queer/gay sexuality had impacted his life as an immigrant to the Netherlands. It was difficult for me to follow his reasoning when he answered, he had a particular way of saying things without saying too much. He was holding information back, I had to find different ways to keep asking things. But from what I understood: His relationship with his sexuality was something he preferred to keep private while young. He wanted to cultivate intellectual pursuits, become highly educated, while leaving the exploration of his sexuality in the backseat until he felt mentally prepared to unpack it.\n</p><p>As a teenage boy he volunteered at the LGBT* association, COC, in Utrecht. There he was able to share parts of his experience with others. As an adult (according to him), he was one of the first openly gay black men in the Netherlands that had a baby with a close queer friend. I asked him multiple times if this was verifiable information. He responded that he and his close friend were interviewed for an article in a newspaper but protected their identity for personal reasons. He had a very proud look on his face and in the ring of his voice. He explained that the Gay Liberation movement happening at the end of the 1960s did not have much impact on him because he did not experience it in a close-contact way. \u201cMy liberation was a very personal experience, it was happening within my mind and my body, not by marching down the streets.\u201d He said it was important for him to first reach the point of self-liberation before he could even think of liberation of the community. We also talked about the pressure of naming one\u2019s sexuality. He personally preferred not using any labels. I noticed that this conversation was becoming more of a critical view on the queer community instead of his personal memories and history. \n</p><p>He then asked, \u201cWhat does it mean for a young queer Cura\u00e7aoan to live in The Netherlands?\u201d while looking straight at me for the answer. I said I sometimes do feel that the white queer experience has been the dominant one here and that I find little sources to relate my queer identity to.\n</p><p>He then asked, \u201cHow can it be that the current generation doesn\u2019t know much about the previous one?\u201d while offering the answer himself. He knew a lot of people from his generation who made trips to Cura\u00e7ao, sharing the knowledge they gathered abroad with the younger generation there. He believed it was possible to transfer this knowledge as a way to create the same awareness of our rights that exists abroad. He believed that we, this current generation, could have more influence on the younger generation of queer Cura\u00e7aoans. \n</p><p>Secret garden parties also came up during our conversation. Apparently, they were by-invitation-only events held in in The Hague for queer people, most of them from the Caribbean. When pressed for more information, he kept holding back. Said he didn\u2019t really go to those kinds of parties because they didn\u2019t really appeal to him. Said he would bring me in contact with people who have more information on this topic.\n</p><p>ASTERISK NOTE: My preferred acronym is LGBTQIA+ when I\u2019m not using the word queer but COC Netherlands still uses the LGBT version.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kapitulo_Tres\">Kapitulo Tres</span></h5>\n<p>Amado (1957)\n</p><p>Through a neighborhood friend, about a year ago I got in contact with Amado. I quickly set up a meeting with him in Rotterdam, where he lives. Amado was born in Aruba. He was and still is very well known for his participation in various beauty pageants organized by and for queer people in the Caribbean. He moved to Cura\u00e7ao in order to be closer to the friends he had made while doing pageantries. He won many of them, was treated like royalty in Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, and found himself many times in newspaper articles. At one point, he felt he had to live life as a transgender woman. He even changed his name from Amado to Amada. \u201cIt just felt like this is who I belonged to be,\u201d he said, looking at an old newspaper article with his picture on it. He had framed the clippings he could save and placed them in a display cabinet. A few years ago, he decided Amada was no longer his true self. Some people still call him Amada, though. \n</p><p>Amado talked mostly about his youth, about beautiful summer romances, about all the times he almost got caught in bed with other men by his father. I asked him about his experience in The Netherlands. He told me he\u2019s really sick, been sick for the last 10 years. He did not tell me exactly what was going on, but I didn\u2019t mind not knowing. Because of his sickness, he lives in a apartment building together with other elderly and ill people, many nearing the end. \n</p><p>I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d \n</p><p>He blushed for a little while and then placed a plate of food and a bottle of beer right under my nose, yelling, \u201cI am with God! Dios ta kumi!\u201d He stared at me. He waited for me to take the first bite of the meal he had just prepared.  I wanted to talk. He wanted me to eat and drink beer.\n</p><p>Amado had been helping homeless people, drug addicts, queer Caribbean teenagers who were kicked out of their homes, and people who migrated from eastern European countries. He offered them food and place to stay at his house. The people he took in were only allowed to stay for two months; otherwise, he\u2019d get irritated. But he did his best to help them find a way to their own home. He often got threatened by his neighbors and the coordinator of the building with being kicked out for giving shelter to people that were not allowed to stay there. \n</p><p>\u201cI still do it. I\u2019ll lie to them, say they\u2019re my cousin or that I\u2019m throwing a party and these are my guests, I don\u2019t care!\u201d It was difficult for him to say much more on the subject because right behind us, there were people sitting, his current \u2018guests\u2019, a man and a woman who looked Polish to me. \n</p><p>Before leaving, I told him that he needed to take care of his health and that I would see him again soon. I haven\u2019t seen him again. Every time we tried to meet, he would cancel because he wasn\u2019t feeling too well.\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Fem.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Fem.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/thumb/3/34/Fem.gif/600px-Fem.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/wiki/images/thumb/3/34/Fem.gif/900px-Fem.gif 1.5x, /wiki/images/thumb/3/34/Fem.gif/1200px-Fem.gif 2x\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Fem.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"V.29.09NINE-QUESTION_AUTO-INTERVIEW\">V)\tNINE-QUESTION AUTO-INTERVIEW</span></h3>\n<p><b>1. How difficult has it been to find sources written by people I can relate to about the experiences that I\u2019m trying to represent?</b>\n</p><p>Queer people around the world have had difficulties concerning historical and cultural presence or, at the very least, documentation of it. In The Netherlands, the queer community as a whole had only started to work on their visibility in the late 19th century. It was challenging to find sources in the form of documents of people from Cura\u00e7ao. It was important for me to find material from sources I could relate to. In the time I had available during this half year, I was able to find a few books and essays by scholars and authors who had researched the experience of queer people of color in The Netherlands. But none could I find that were specifically about people from Cura\u00e7ao\u2014or any other island with a Dutch colonial past. I did not see it as failure but as testament to what I already suspected about our (in)visibility and (mis)representation within The Netherlands. I did however get a chance to read what I felt were sources similar to what I was looking for. They were about Surinamese and Moroccan communities (Verboden liefde: Familie en homoseksualiteit in de Surinaamse gemeenschap by Sandew Hira, Gewurgd door taboes: Veranderingen in de acceptatie van homoseksualiteit onder Surinaams Hindustanen in Nederland by Anita C. Nanhoe and Jurriaan Omlo) and black queer men in the United Kingdom (Black and Gay in the UK - An Anthology by John R. Gordon and Rikki Beadle-Blair). They were able to give me some insight into the experience of the queer community in relation to colonialist countries. I still felt like I was left with an exposed gap that needed filling with Cura\u00e7aoan queerness, people that are living or had lived in the Netherlands when they were young adults. This might mean they had more freedom to live and explore their sexuality than when they were still underage, not negating that they might have had this experience during their younger years in Cura\u00e7ao as well. \n</p><p><i>DISCARDED NOTE: Why aren\u2019t these stories told? How can we protect our Caribbean queer cultural heritage? Where does it belong?</i>\n</p><p>For me to do this work of filling, I had to come in contact with a larger network through organizations like The Black Archives, Vereniging Ons Suriname, and the newly created LGBTQIA+ peer-coaching group at the Hogeschool Rotterdam. I would visit these places in search of any documents, books, or films that they could have saved, while using this opportunity to have one-on-one conversations with the people working there. I told them about my search effort and why it is of value for me and for better representation of the community. They responded by introducing me to people they thought would help me move forward in my project. \n</p><p><br />\n<b>2. Who is the ideal audience for this work?</b>\n</p><p>The ideal audience for my work, first of all,* would have to be the locals of Cura\u00e7ao and the diaspora here in The Netherlands. I wasn\u2019t looking to find people of color from Cura\u00e7ao exclusively. Like I\u2019ve stated before, I am well aware that when speaking of people of color living in the Netherlands, I am referring to a larger African diaspora.\n</p><p>ASTERISK NOTE: During my teenage years in highschool we were taught to use ter eerste, ten tweede, (first of all, second of all), etc\u2026 in order to give our Dutch essays more credibility and an official, important feel. We would have to use these techniques to show we were knowledgeable in Dutch. If you knew how to say these words, you were perceived as knowing how to speak Dutch. \n</p><p><i>DISCARDED NOTE: How intelligible do I want to be for those who are not able to see my surroundings the way I see it, the way I live it?</i>\n</p><p><br />\n<b>3. Is it possible or advisable to transfer lived experiences/embodied wisdom from the diaspora to the homeland without translation?</b>\n</p><p>We not only have to look at better the representation of the queer diaspora of Cura\u00e7ao in The Netherlands but also find critically the best way to translate this to the locals on the homeland. The lived experiences/embodied wisdom from the diaspora should never be literally relocated and placed in the context of Cura\u00e7ao, but used as a way to have a dialogue with, first the queer community of the island to see where there is possibility to grow in their own experiences and what they believe is important for them to have as part of the community of Cura\u00e7ao. \nThen it\u2019s also of importance that they can have these kinds of dialogues with the rest of the community. These events would be necessary in order to talk about the bigger issues embedded within the culture that are not always made available to discuss because it\u2019s been made easier to blame all things wrong to the seemingly weakest or seen sinful according to religious system that holds the cultural values in place. \nBelle Hooks stated in her essay \u2018Understanding Patriarchy\u2019:\n</p><p>\u201cPsychotherapist John Bradshaw\u2019s clear-sighted definition of patriarchy in Creating Love is a useful one: \u2018The dictionary defines \u2018patriarchy\u2019 as a \u2018social organization marked\u2028by the supremacy of the father in the clan or family in both domestic and religious functions\u2019.\u201d Patriarchy is characterized by male domination and power. He states further that \u2018patriarchal rules still govern most of the world\u2019s religious, school systems, and family systems.\u2019 Describing the most damaging of these rules, Bradshaw lists \u2018blind obedience\u2014the foundation upon which patriarchy stands; the repression of all emotions except fear; the destruction of individual willpower; and the repression of thinking whenever it departs from the authority figure\u2019s way of thinking.\u2019 Patriarchal thinking shapes the values of our culture. We are socialized into this system, females as well as males. Most of us learned patriarchal attitudes in our family of origin, and they were usually taught to us by our mothers. These attitudes were reinforced in schools and religious institutions.\u201d\n</p><p>This can be related to my work in the way that this social organization plays a very important role in the cultural archive and with that the consciousness of the inhabitants of Cura\u00e7ao. There\u2019s this chauvinistic idea that preserves dominance and excludes any seemingly weak characteristics to the male person. A group of researchers of the Western Carolina University in the US suggest that men who use sexist and anti-gay humour do so to reaffirm their own sense of self, particularly when they feel their masculinity is being threatened. Study author Emma O\u2019Connor explained: \n</p><p><br />\n\u201cMen higher in precarious manhood beliefs expressed amusement with sexist and anti-gay humour in response to a masculinity threat because they believe it reaffirms an accurate, more masculine impression of them. It appears that by showing amusement with sexist and anti-gay humour, such men can distance themselves from the traits they want to disconfirm,\u201d\n</p><p>Restoring Threatened Masculinity: The Appeal of Sexist and Anti-Gay Humor\n</p><p><br />\nThis experiment was conducted on 166 heterosexual men and limited to residents of the United States. There were 110 (66%) Whites, 19 (11%) African-Americans, 11 (7%) Hispanics, 20 (12%) Asians, 3 (2%) Native American and 3 (2%) people who self-identified as other. This could serve an indication of in the diaspora here in The Netherlands. Which is why this work is necessary in order to share what the lived experiences are of the queer people of Cura\u00e7ao.\n</p><p><i>DISCARDED NOTE: I often felt like I still had to assimilate to what would be accepted even though I was now in a country where it was allowed. Assimilation in order to not feel ashamed because a majority of the community here, either descendant of or have migrated from the Caribbean, would still judge our sexuality and judge it as something we should be ashamed of.</i>  \n</p><p><br />\n<b>4. Some of the people that I interviewed expressed how they wanted to transfer their experience of acceptance here in The Netherlands back home to the Caribbean, is that what I want to do now?</b>\n</p><p>Some of the people that I interviewed spoke about when they were younger and went back to the island. They tried to transfer the experience of acceptance that they had achieved to a certain extent here in The Netherlands. They created a small zine called Bolletin in cooperation with Grupo Homofilia Antiyano. Their intentions:\n</p><p>\"om voorlichting te geven en een bijdrage te leveren aan een open samenleving door taboes bespreekbaar te maken.\"\n</p>\n<pre>Dolly Bellefleur\n</pre>\n<p>Translation: \u2018to provide information and to contribute to an open society by making taboos open to discussion.\u2019 \n</p><p>This is not necessarily what I want to achieve with my work. Transfer is different from translate. Taboos are interwoven within the existing culture in each place. What works in one side doesn\u2019t necessarily work in another. Either way, I see this work as the first step to a long process of understanding, self-discovery and making space for dialogues between queer Cura\u00e7aoans and also the non-queer community in Cura\u00e7ao and The Netherlands.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>5. Why did I choose to present my work as a performance?</b>\n</p><p>I have recently reconnected myself with the power of the performance. I find it extremely interesting how it can be used as a device to translate narratives. \n</p><p>There\u2019s a reason why people of color find the medium of performance a powerful way to show hidden/subliminal feelings, in ways that words on paper alone cannot do. It\u2019s a shared cultural understanding (or myth) of the people from Cura\u00e7ao that we express ourselves through performance. A large part of the culture is to celebrate the heritage. This is visible for example during Carnival and the Seu season.\n</p><p>There are two parts to the performance. One version has been previously recorded and will be displayed on four old school television sets. These four TVs will be placed on stools and will stand on both sides of where the performer will be placed live during the final exam and the graduation show. \n</p><p>The performance for Kas di mariku is about the youngest generation of queer Cura\u00e7aoans, both locals and diaspora, who are told the stories of our queer predecessors. While hearing about these experiences, the performer will tenderly begin covering himself with glitter. He first begins with his arms and continues to his upper body. Every new part of his body he reaches is making him realize how, the more stories he\u2019s exposed to, the more visible he becomes. Each story makes him feel a different part of what it means to explore his queer sexual identity. At times, he feels completely in tune with his masculinity while at the same time curiously exploring the realm of femininity and all that lies between these two binaries. There\u2019s still visible hold-back in his experience, he has to advance every step with caution because what lies ahead is still somewhat uncertain and unknown. \n</p><p>As time passes by and the stories keep coming in, he starts to mouth the same words of the stories that are being told. These stories are rooting themselves into his consciousness; creating connections with his own personal experiences he previously was unaware of there existence.\n</p><p>In the end, the performer will be completely covered in glitter, giving him a second layer of visibility. This new visibility was created with the help of past stories but placed by his conscious ability. \n</p><p><i>DISCARDED NOTE: It was visible while talking to the elders that there were hesitant with how much of their personal stories they were willing to share. Exchange of personal memories allowed for the fear to dissolve.</i>\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Blue_softness.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Blue softness.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/0/0f/Blue_softness.gif\" width=\"1450\" height=\"1088\" /></a></div></div>\n<p><b>6. Do I think it\u2019s possible for the queer community to reclaim the word \u2018mariku\u2019?</b>\n</p><p>Saying the word mariku leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. And every time I hear it being said out loud in my vicinity I sometimes have an immediate response and start nervously looking around for who had fired this bullet out into the open like tha. Mariku is still predominantly used as a homophobic slur, the equivalent of the word faggot in English or mietje in Dutch. To understand the word mariku and the weight it carries, it is important to understand where it actually came from. The word itself has its roots set in the Spanish language. On the blog El Observatorio GLTB under the post \u2018Etimolog\u00eda de \u201cMaric\u00f3n\u201d\u2019 translation: Etymology of \u201cMaric\u00f3n\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cEn ese origen, \u201cMaria\u201d, est\u00e1 el origen de la asociaci\u00f3n de \u201cmarica\u201d con lo femenino. Pero el desprecio proviene de la descripci\u00f3n asociada a la palabra que es \u201cvar\u00f3n que se comporta como una mujer\u201d, o \u201cvar\u00f3n que ha abandonado su conducta social masculina para comportarse como una mujer\u201d.\n</p><p>La connotaci\u00f3n de desprecio encuentra su fuente en que una persona nacida var\u00f3n haya adoptado comportamientos no del sexo opuesto, sino del sexo inferior. El problema se encuadra claramente en la perspectiva de g\u00e9nero: lo masculino es considerado superior; lo femenino es considerado inferior. El marica es despreciado porque siendo Mario, se porta como Mar\u00eda: porque , teniendo el derecho de nacimiento a ser superior, decide parecerse a lo inferior. Por ello se los sindica como despreciables e incluso moralmente culpable.\u201d\n</p><p>Translation: \u201cIn that origin, \u2018Maria\u2019, is the origin of the association of \u2018marica\u2019 with the feminine. But contempt comes from the description associated with the word that is \u2018a man who behaves like a woman,\u2019 or \u2018a man who has abandoned his male performativity social behavior to behave like a woman.\u2019\n</p><p>The connotation of contempt finds its source in that a person born male has adopted behaviors not of the opposite sex, but of the inferior sex. The problem is clearly framed in the gender perspective: the masculine is considered superior; the feminine is considered inferior. The sissy is despised because, being Mario, he behaves like Mar\u00eda: because, having the right to be superior, he decides to resemble the inferior. That is why they are syndicated as despicable and even morally guilty.\u201d\n</p><p>I, same as many others queers that have lived our lives speaking Papiamentu, have learned that a few words like this one could make you feel unsafe and insecure in an instant or defensive in an attempt to secure one\u2019s macho cover-up. Recently, the word has been through some changes in cultural meaning where calling someone mariku is not necessarily exposing or conforming the queer sexuality of its receiver but more or less a term of endearment that friends, both cisgender and queer, use to call each other out for not being direct, for copping out.\n</p><p>It definitely did not erase the context of being effeminate or weak or something a heterosexual Cura\u00e7aoan man wouldn\u2019t want to be defined as. I\u2019ve seen it happen before when communities are able to reclaim words that are demeaning or hurtful and make others realize the impact it has on the person being called that word. \n</p><p>Yusuf Tamanna (June 19 2018) stated in the think piece \u201cWhen did we start referring to ourselves as queer?\u201d on i-D:\n</p><p>\u201cIts reclamation began in the 1960s. In America, the gay rights movement had begun. Many of its activists identified as queer in an act of defiance and resilience to police brutality.\u201d\n</p><p>In 1990 when Queer Nation\u2014an LGBTQIA+ organization founded by AIDS activists\u2014 was born in New York, they released pamphlet during the pride that year called Queers Read This, which created the initiative to reclaim the word queer. It challenged: \n\u201cWell, yes, \u2018gay\u2019 is great. It has its place. But when a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we've chosen to call ourselves queer. Using \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world. It's a way of telling ourselves we don't have to be witty and charming people who keep our lives discreet and marginalised in the straight world. We use queer as gay men loving lesbians and lesbians loving being queer. Queer, unlike GAY, doesn't mean MALE.\u201d\n</p><p>I am aware that in this particular case were are dealing with a different set of cultural rules, social constructs and ways that the community can excuse most of the horrible things that happen to us and turn it into comedy, making fun of something we actually all know is hurtful. But before we get to the point where the queer community that speaks Papiamentu is able to reclaim the word mariku, there are certain things that would have to happen. One of them is to understand the leading role that patriarchal masculinity that plays in the culture of Cura\u00e7ao. \n</p><p><i>DISCARDED NOTE: I get a weird feeling every time I start to tell someone about my personal life. I am not ashamed of being queer person of color or for being a queer parent, I just cringe every time someone says something like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know any Cura\u00e7aoan gay couple here in The Netherlands that have foster kids, do you?\u2019</i>\n</p><p><br />\n<b>7. How important is it to me that the rest of the audience (non-Afro-Caribbean/Cura\u00e7aoans) fully understand my work?</b>\n</p><p>I don\u2019t believe that by making the work completely understandable for everyone else that is not from Cura\u00e7ao is of importance. There is power in knowing that I can direct it towards those who I know can understand it. As an artist of the diaspora,I\u2019d like to make visible things that for many years were difficult to understand, and still are because there was little to no space for it to be explored, brought to the eyes of those that had needed most to see it. I\u2019m afraid that, in my effort of making it clear for the audience of this exhibition at WdKA, I might lose the connection to those whom the work is actually for. \n</p><p><br />\n<b>8. Where do I think is the ideal natural habitat for this work in terms of exhibition space?</b>\n</p><p>This work would fit best if it were placed in an environment where it would more directly reach the Cura\u00e7aoan diaspora with a heteronormative view on sexuality. I\u2019ve thought of a few possible places where they would come together like at the barbershops, toko\u2019s, and Caribbean restaurants. Also, during events where we celebrate our cultural background like for example the Summer Carnival. It could serve as an opportunity where time and space would be safely and carefully created for dialogues about the queer community. I want to go beyond the idea of you can be mariku if you want as long as you don\u2019t bring that near me. \n</p><p>\u201cBo por ta mariku si bo ke, biba bo bida, pero basta bo no bini akibandanan mes.\u201d \n</p><p>It might be seen at first as if I am trying to produce a bad response, like poking the bear\u2014or in this case the heterosexual black man, even woman. But creating this confrontation it would affirm that homosexuality is still something the cis-community does not want to embrace. Bringing this forward would perhaps be the first step in allowing a process of change. What is seen can be addressed.  \n</p><p><br />\n<b>9. If the ideal audience is not the audience seeing this exhibition, </b>\ndoes this work still have value?\n</p><p>Considering the time, resources and connections I have available at the moment, while I\u2019m graduating I\u2019ve decided that I would much rather focus temporarily on the placement of this work in the graduation show at the WdKA. I\u2019m aware that the audience this work is actually for would not be the audience attending the graduation show. But even in this case, this work is also of relevance for those who are not part of the Afro-Caribbean queer community. I want to broaden the perspective of the queer discourse, which here in The Netherlands is dominated by the white queer narrative. It is of even more relevance for those who are part of the queer community here to see the same issues from another lens with its own experiences and discourse.\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/wiki/index.php/File:Yellow_dancer.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Yellow dancer.gif\" src=\"/wiki/images/5/57/Yellow_dancer.gif\" width=\"720\" height=\"576\" /></a></div></div>\n<p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"VI.29.09CONCLUSION\">VI)\tCONCLUSION</span></h3>\n<p>Reflecting upon my experience the last couple of months, I can recall how I initially sought out to produce evidence of Cura\u00e7aoan queer participation in the face of historical and cultural absence here in The Netherlands. \n</p><p>The lack of documentation on the non-white queer Dutch community from the early beginnings of the Gay Liberation movement have reasons as simple as \u201cmeetings were not advertised\u201d or \u201cthere was no organization besides the COC Netherlands who was producing culture.\u201d The lack of primary and secondary sources also made the search for these poorly visible actors, keepers of important oral narratives, even more difficult. \n</p><p>With the people and the stories that I was able to find I want to create a better understanding for the queer generation of our collective past. We have now moved forward in terms of visibility and equal rights, compared to the 60s and 70s when Felix de Rooy, Glenn Helberg and Amado were exploring their own liberation within their limitations in The Netherlands. Understanding and acceptance remain two very important points for me to strive towards if we want to broaden perspective of the white queer and cisgender community here. \n</p><p>With my work, I\u2019d like to start the dialogue with others of the queer Cura\u00e7aoan community to discuss the use of the word mariku. We could understand why certain things should change and why certain things remain the same in our social behavior. Words like mariku that only serve to divide us even more into unequal power structures.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"VII.29.09CONCLUSION_TO_MY_CONCLUSION\">VII)\tCONCLUSION TO MY CONCLUSION</span></h3>\n<h5><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"It_should.E2.80.99ve_been_exhibited_in_a_barbershop\">It should\u2019ve been exhibited in a barbershop</span></h5>\n<p>Looking critically back at the results so far, there are a few things that I would\u2019ve liked to do differently. Six months ago, I was moving in a (familiar) landscape that was almost unknown to me. It\u2019s clear now that I need to dig deeper for theoretical  knowledge that would help me unravel or/and continue building on these intricate Cura\u00e7aoan queer life stories.\n</p><p>This is a project I intend to continue working on. I have met a few people in the time that was available, but I know that this process takes much more time in a much bigger scale, tackling a variety of different subjects. For now, this is the first stepping-stone to continue moving further after graduation.\n</p><p>As I\u2019ve said before, the natural habitat for my work is in a Cura\u00e7aoan Barbershop. It is in this space that it would be tested against the cultural norms of the Cura\u00e7ao straight male.

We always talk about the outcome of indoctrination, with mass media focusing on the latest terrorist attacks or airing TV shows like \u201cMy life in a cult\u201d. We hardly talk about the process itself. There is never just one 'red flag' moment, there are however a lot of little 'pink' ones that together can make a real impact on a child's future decisions.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"About_the_project\">About the project</span></h2>\n<p>In this short animation I want to portray the subtle ways of childhood indoctrination. In many cases parents don\u2019t indoctrinate their children because they hate them, it\u2019s the opposite. They just want the best for their child by bringing them up with their specific theology or world view. They are doing it out of love. This part of the process of indoctrination is not visible to the outside world. This is what I want to show in my animation. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<div class='embedvideo autoResize' style=''><div class='embedvideowrap'

We are at the helm of a diverse set of educational initiatives, special projects and publications that demonstrate the power of design for social innovation: an emergent field of design inquiry and practice that is oriented toward new possibilities for action and human progress. I will briefly explain here how we connect to practices in the field and how we perceive the future role of designers in society.</div>\n<div class=\"article\">\n<p>Author: Susannah Ramshaw\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vibrant_hub_for_strategic_collaborations\">Vibrant hub for strategic collaborations</span></h2>\n<p>'Designmatters' is an educational department (non-degree granting) that engages all majors taught at the College with a dynamic, entrepreneurial and experiential approach to design education. Designmatters serves as a vibrant hub for strategic collaborations near and far from ArtCenter's campuses in Pasadena. In 2002, Designmatters established the significant and pioneering affiliation of the College as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations. For more than a decade, the department has built a broad network of innovative collaborations with social, public and private sector organizations that are striving to design a better and more humane future for all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Human-centered_and_immersive_quality\">Human-centered and immersive quality</span></h2>\n<p>The most singular and distinctive aspect of the educational model offered in the trans-disciplinary Designmatters studios is their human-centered and immersive quality \u2013 one connected to the real-time/real-world framework of this experiential and project-based model of learning. Furthermore, because there is always an aspiration to collaborate with external partners to create novel and useful solutions that may be implemented after the educational engagement is over, students often receive training and support to incubate projects beyond the confines of the initial development of the project in the studio. \nSince its inception in 2001, Designmatters has produced over 100 social innovation design projects, including print and multimedia campaigns, documentaries, public service announcements, educational toolkits, products, installations, and more. Over 90% of these projects have moved forward to real-world implementation by our strategic partners. In this way, Designmatters students are able to see their current work in action and recognize the positive impact their designs have on different levels of scale, from the local to the global.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_LEAP_Dialogues\">The LEAP Dialogues</span></h2>\n<p>The role of design and designers in society and the marketplace is changing. We wish to anticipate upon that. Recently we published The LEAP Dialogues about why these changes are happening, which skills are needed to stay relevant, and how new practices are emerging. The focus is on career pathways for designers in social innovation. Below you will find two excepts from these LEAP Dialogues, which we hope may inspire you in your own development.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Excerpt_1:_Overcoming_Limitations_in_Social_Design\">Excerpt 1: Overcoming Limitations in Social Design</span></h3>\n<p><b>A Dialogue between Valerie Casey, Founder and Executive Director, and the designers Accord &amp; Barry Katz, California College of the Arts</b> \n</p><p>VC: To designers looking for ways to actively engage in these nearly intractable challenges, I would give three pieces of clear advice: \n</p><p>Creativity in itself is not novel; it's the execution of creative ideas that matters. All ideas sound brilliant and life-changing as they roll around inside our heads. But as designers, that's not enough. We are uniquely equipped to make things: to build, code, draw, write. My definition of a successful idea is one that can change people, at scale. In social impact, there is no room for vanity projects. Focus on making and reaching.  \n</p><p>Study your subject. This is no place for the beginner's mind. There has been a prevailing belief in the design community that designers we will be less capable of expansive, creative thought if they are tainted with too much information about their subjects. The designer's conceit is to view the world with fresh eyes, unencumbered with context and knowledge. When trying to make a meaningful impact on large social problems, this is a failing strategy. It is critical to do deep preparatory work in order to really understand the complexities of the systems that shape these areas. It is just naive and limiting (and offensive) to try design an intervention in an impoverished neighborhood with the same method used to design a bicycle helmet.  \n</p><p>Learn math. The healthcare system in the United States is built on an accounting system. Venture capital investment is dictating the pace of technology. Data and predictive science is fueled by advertising platforms. Regardless of skill-set and discipline, no one can engage in making social change without understanding the economic conditions that govern these systems. Financial fluency is the biggest advantage designers can have if they truly want to have impact.  \n</p><p>Do you agree, Barry? Any sacred cows in design that you think we need to kill in order to unlock new thinking and capabilities?  \n</p><p>BK: Our thinking is very closely aligned here. In fact, I am inclined to amplify some of your key points and explore some of their implications. I have done my fair share in promoting the idea of 'design thinking', but I sometimes fear that we have created a monster that has taken on a life of its own. The core concept, in my mind, was always the notion that the methods and techniques \u2013 and what you very rightly emphasize as the 'craft' \u2013 of the designer can be applied on a vastly expanded scale: from discrete electromechanical devices to integrated socioeconomic systems; from symptoms of dysfunction to the causes of dysfunction; from products to processes. But it was never my belief that this principle could be reduced to a five-part methodology that could be taught in a three-hour workshop, and voila! everybody is now a certified 'design thinker'! There's some evidence that this misconception has already begun to take a bite out of the practices of some of our local consultancies, as former clients scramble to deploy Design Thinking units within their organizations. I think it was Winston Churchill who said, 'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.'  \nThere is a positive note to this, however, and in this respect I absolutely share your sense of optimism and (if I'm not mistaken) excitement: I believe that the extraordinary popularity of design thinking, and the growing recognition that the skills, thought processes and craft of the designer can be applied not just to solving problems but to identifying opportunities, and will create a receptiveness to the level of professionalism that is really required if we are to address the truly 'wicked' problems of our time. I brush and I floss, but I still go to the dentist.  \n</p><p>I am reminded of the crisis that beset the design community when MacDraw and MacPaint seemed poised to turn every secretary, middle-school student and scrapbooker into a 'graphic designer'. For a moment there was panic across the land, but the unexpected result was to press the professional community to articulate with clarity and precision the value that it added. We are perhaps at such a point today: The example of Apple, the incorporation of design into the operations of venture capital firms, hospitals, nongovernmental organizations, financial institutions \u2013 even the military \u2013 has given the design community the opening it has dreamed of literally for decades. Designers need to stop complaining and learn to take 'yes' for an answer.  \n</p><p>So what are we to do, now that we have gained the credibility we have sought for so long? Where will we start? How should we begin to apply our craft to problems that matter? \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Excerpt_2:_Learn_Before_You_Leap.3F_Lessons_from_Design_Educators.\">Excerpt 2: Learn Before You Leap? Lessons from Design Educators.</span></h3>\n<p><b>By Allan Chochinov, Chair, MFA Products of Design, School of Visual Arts &amp; Partner, Core 77</b> \n</p><p>Below you will find an assortment of answers from some of the leading thinkers and practitioners in American design education. They were asked a couple of questions: 'What are the essential qualities or skills to master in order to thrive in the potential professional roles available to them?' and 'What are your aspirations for the kinds of professional roles and career pathways you wish your students might be able to access in the future?' The answers were diverse in content, yet singular in profile \u2013 they were humanistic and they were ethical. And no wonder: since social design is fundamentally social, words like 'empathic' and 'conversation' and 'listening' and 'confidence' appear repeatedly. But even more ubiquitous were notions around responsibility, criticality, values, meaning and positive change. Indeed, there is an underlying desire for fairness and equity that distinguishes this kind of design work.  \n</p><p>Furthermore, where most of design practice these days prides itself on being 'user centered', social design educators include the planet, other living things and all of the intermingled systems that bind them as protagonists in their work. It is this holistic approach that is perhaps most urgently needed in schools, along with the time and space for students to develop an individual moral compass.  \n</p><p>Finally, they were emphatic. Repeatedly, educators talked about leadership, about impact and about transformation. These are big terms demanded for big challenges, and each seemed confident in a better future. \n</p><p>As an illustration we end this expert with some answers from Educators looking to the future. We asked them: what are the essential qualities and/or skills your students should master in order to thrive in the potential professional roles available to them? \n</p><p><b>Elizabeth Gerber, Northwestern University</b>\n</p><p><i>Three E's: Empathy, Experimentation and Enthusiasm.</i> \n</p><p><b>Shalini Agrawal, CCA</b> \n\nThe single most important skill today's creative practitioner should master is the ability to listen. Listening is the foundation of collaboration and should be developed as a core competency. It places new professionals at the nexus of discovering innovative opportunities and redefining the face of leadership.<i>  </i>\n</p><p><b>Mike Weikert, Maryland Institute College of Art:</b>\n</p><p><i>Students must be lifelong learners and purposeful questioners, committed to gaining a higher level of social literacy. Add a combination of inherent qualities (creative, intuitive, humble, empathetic, optimistic, respectful, collaborative, fearless) and acquired skills (design research, process, systems, storytelling, visualization, facilitation, entrepreneurship) and future designers will thrive.</i> \n</p><p><b>Debera Johnson, Pratt Institute: </b>\n</p><p><i>Mastery in curiosity, listening, empathy, respect and the patience for allowing for things to evolve within a system will be critical for making change. My favorite quote lately is a Chinese proverb: The time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.</i> \n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><b>About LEAP:</b>\n</p>\n<i>LEAP is available for sale from Distributed Art Publishers.

Beyond Social is written and edited by its community. Contribute to this online publishing platform with an article (text, photo-essay, video, audio and so on) about your project, theory, event or initiative in the field of Social Art &amp; Design.</div>\n<div class=\"small column quarter\"><b>Edit</b> this page, or any of the other ones. If there is any missing information or spelling mistakes in this article, please don't hesitate to change it. Other complementing work, such as including media files (images/video's/audio) is also very much appreciated.</div>\n<div class=\"small column quarter\"><b><a href=\"/wiki/index.php?title=Talk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Talk (page does not exist)\">Talk</a></b> with the contributers and others by taking part in one of the discussions on the TALK-page of an article. These pages are the semi-hidden backside of articles, hence ideal for discussions about an article without changing the initial text.</div>\n<div class=\"small column quarter\"><b>PROPOSE</b> a new editorial. Beyond Social invites guest editor(s) to emphasize a certain issue, topic or theme. Guest editors write an editorial, invite others to create articles by an open call and/or add existing articles. </div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20181012094126\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\n[SMW] In\u2010text annotation parser time: 0.004 seconds\nCPU time usage: 0.062 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.102 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 326/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 1181/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 25445/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 13274/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 3/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   49.077      1 -total\n 92.80%   45.546      1 Template:Articles_more\n  4.84%    2.374     10 Template:Articles\n  4.53%    2.221      1 Template:Contribute\n  2.97%    1.459      1 Template:Article\n  2.07%    1.018      1 Template:Links_external\n  1.64%    0.807      1 Template:Category_selector\n-->\n",
