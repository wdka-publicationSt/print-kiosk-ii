		<div class="article_content"><p>Stitch, Embroidery in South Madagascar Michael Rafferty, year 2 Illustration/social practice, WDKA</p>
<p>Stitch is a embroidery project set up in south Madagascar to help the women of a area called Saint Luce. The project was set up to help the women of the town specifically, as there were previously little to no jobs available for them. The men are nearly all fishermen, earning as little as €16 a month, not enough to support their family. The charity has been so successful that now a lot of elder men, married to the women, are being taught also, as the embroidery has become more lucrative that fishing.</p>
<p>Sarah Brown, an embroidery designer from the UK started the project back in 2011, she visited the area whilst on a conservation programme and saw the dire situation that the town and the women were in. Amour Paula, who started as a translator, but is now a crucial part of the business and helping train new starters has helped her since day one.</p>
<p>The business design is simple, first teach a small group of women to use the simple embroidery patterns that Sarah has designed herself and then sell the material around the more touristic parts of Africa as well as over the Internet to the wider world using Sarah’s business and fashion connections. Not all the designs are Sarah’s as she encourages the women to contribute their own designs and helps with creativity also.</p>
<p>The Project is a great example of open design; Sarah has given her designs to the community and taught several groups how to embroider. Once the women know how to embroider and have access to the materials, they are welcome to bring people into the community by teaching friends and family also. At first this did cause some social issues, as the men fishing were earning much less than their wives for the first time in the areas history. This was solved by letting some of the men get involved, but only those at a request from one of the original women, mostly husbands and sons.</p>
<p>Apart from financial gain, there was a hugely positive social impact for the women of the community; Firstly making a living and contributing to their families gave the women a huge boost of self-esteem, spending time in the studio with each other created a sense of community that had been previously missing, and led to some of the women opening up about problems at home as well as other problems in their lives. It also gave some of the widowed women security ¬-being part of a group that looks out for each other.</p>
<p>The group keep coming up with innovative ways to make the project more successful, from pitching a stall at Glastonbury festival, to hunting down more local products to add to their range. The team’s latest project has been to learn from another fabric maker in Madagascar about naturally dyed silk, with an expansion of another line of products, this could mean bringing in more people from the local area into the business, and more families sharing in this new revenue stream. ¬¬¬</p>
<p>Whilst trying to discover more about the local area online there is very little information about the place. Wikipedia recognises its existence but has nothing to say about it. A few travel bloggers have written about the area and all say something very similar, which is that there is very little there more than an amenities shop, and as many fishing boats as people. The area is split up into lots of village areas so nobody I found had stumbled on the project, and this may well be a nice thing so that the workers and go about making their work in peace and it being sold elsewhere, rather than the whole thing turn into a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>There are a few big conservation projects in the local area dedicated to helping the local plants and wildlife, and Stitch ensures that all the materials inks and everything else that’s used are from sustainable and ethical sources. Apart from this being important to Sarah and the others I think it is integral for business as their target market will most likely be very socially conscious.</p>
<p>At the minute the company is only seeing positive outcomes, however there was an initial bit of jealousy when it became apparent that these women were all of a sudden the highest earners of the local area. This was solved by the company branching out al letting people share in the prophet, but when a society changes and a balance shifts away from the traditional ‘bread winners‘ it can often create social issues, this is something Sarah and the team are conscious of and are working very carefully, trying not start any problems.</p>
<p>I learnt about Stitch When visited by Sarah during my foundation year at Leeds college of Art, the institution she previously studied at. There is very little second hand information on the company apart from their own website: <a href="http://www.stitchsainteluce.org/" class="uri" class="external free">http://www.stitchsainteluce.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Steeds meer ontwerpers beschouwen het maken van een bussinessmodel ook als ontwerpopgave. Door de financiële crisis en maatschappelijke transitie zijn oude zekerheden vloeibaar geworden en ontstaan nieuwe businessmodellen. Businessmodellen waarbij nieuwe en reeds aanwezige geldstromen, lokaal ondernemerschap, sociaal kapitaal, open netwerken, energietransitie en nieuwe technologie de basis vormen voor meervoudige waardecreatie. Steeds meer ontwerpers en kunstenaars spelen een rol in het ontwikkelen van deze nieuwe businessmodellen.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Een nieuwe ontwerppraktijk</strong></p>
<p>Er is een nieuwe ontwerppraktijk ontstaan waarbij het niet meer alleen gaat om het vormgeven van een mooie tafel, goed gebouw of fijne wijk, maar waarin de processen rondom het tot stand komen van de tafel, het gebouw of de wijk ook als ontwerpopgave wordt gezien. Steeds meer designers delen hun ontwerp op een 'open source' manier en geven consumenten invloed op het maakproces door hen het product mee te laten ontwikkelen, financieren of maken. Denk aan initiatieven als CRWDBLDNG van Space&amp;matter, Blauwhoed en Open Development en het project Wikihouse van Strategy Office 00://. Nieuwe vormen van eigenaarschap doen hun intrede; lokale initiatieven claimen leegstaande gebouwen en buren richten eigen energiecoöperaties op. Daarnaast wordt de circulaire economie steeds vaker als uitweg gezien voor zowel de ecologische als de economische crisis. Denk aan de projecten als Villa Welpeloo van Superuse Studios, Biobased Retrofit house van Duzan Doepel en De Ceuvel van Metabolic Lab en Space&amp;matter. In dergelijke projecten veranderen lokale zaken (afval, energie, local communities &amp; expertise) in waardevolle assets. In al deze projecten hebben de ontwerpers niet alleen het fysieke eindobject ontworpen, maar ook het bijbehorende business-model mee-ontworpen en heeft dat invloed op de verschijningsvorm. Door de context mee te ontwerpen worden ook voor het fysieke ontwerp andere dingen mogelijk dan voorheen.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Social practices</strong></p>
<p>Ontwerpers die vanuit een dergelijk opvatting over wat zij tot hun werkterrein rekenen werken, zijn te scharen onder wat je ‘social practices’ zou kunnen noemen. Social practices zijn de laatste tijd behoorlijk in zwang geraakt. Hun opleving in het huidige kunst-, onderwijs- en designdiscours komt niet uit de lucht vallen. Het is een reactie op een samenleving in transitie. Onze samenleving is altijd in verandering maar momenteel lijken deze veranderingen heftiger, sneller en op meer terreinen gaande dan we gewend waren. Volgens velen is de toekomst niet louter een extrapolatie van dat wat we reeds kennen, maar is er sprake van een systeemverandering op diverse vlakken, in verschillende disciplines en op verschillende schaalniveaus tegelijkertijd. Hoe groot of klein deze systeemverandering ook is, social practitioners kiezen er expliciet voor haar te onderzoeken, bevragen of mede vorm te geven. Goede social designers en social artists kunnen zich op eigenzinnige wijze positioneren als gamechanger. Het is niet zo gek dat ontwerpers zich momenteel op dit terrein begeven. Enerzijds lijkt de tijd rijp om aan de slag te gaan met het ontwikkelen van alternatieve businessmodellen; de oude manier van zaken doen werkt niet meer of is onwenselijk gebleken. Anderzijds helpen tools uit de creatieve disciplines - zoals design-thinking en systemic analysis - om tot nieuwe businessmodellen te komen.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Systeemverandering</strong></p>
<p>Waar sommigen denken dat we na het uitzitten van de huidige economische crisis weer terug zullen gaan naar hoe de zaken voor de crisis georganiseerd waren, stellen anderen dat de wereld van straks niet meer zal lijken op de wereld van toen. De Russische econoom Nikolai Kondratieff heeft laten zien dat een crisis altijd volgt op een maatschappelijke omwenteling zoals de industriële revolutie of de introductie van de auto. Wat deze crises gemeen hebben is dat de wereld ná de crisis er compleet anders uitziet dan ervóór; met andere organisatiestructuren, verdienmodellen en andere spelers aan het roer. Indien men de huidige crisis ook ziet als zo’n omslagpunt is dat een aanleiding om zowel de creatieve disciplines als bestaande businessmodellen opnieuw te overdenken. De economie kende de afgelopen eeuw een steeds grotere mate van top-down regulering, uniformiteit en grootschaligheid, waarvan de burger zich afhankelijk opstelde. Nieuwe generaties begeven zich echter in toenemende mate in meer horizontale structuren. Ze bewegen zich in allerlei (onzichtbare) netwerken en zijn via snelle en flexibele structuren maatschappelijk en politiek betrokken. Tegelijkertijd is ook een tegenovergestelde dynamiek waarneembaar; een dynamiek van voortgaande consumptie, individualisering, schaalvergroting en clustering van macht in steeds minder maar grotere multinationals. Daarnaast stellen vergrijzing, vraagstukken in de zorg, economische en demografische krimp, voedsel- en waterproblematieken ons voor nieuwe uitdagingen. Varend op de woelige baren van dergelijke ontwikkelingen opperen verschillende denkers en ontwerpers een systeemverandering; er wordt een omslag gemaakt van de grote naar kleine schaal, van hoge investeringen aan de start naar een meer geleidelijke cashflowplanning, van situaties met enkele leidende professionals naar een praktijk met vele spelers, van eindbeeld naar startbeeld, van vertrouwen op standaardmethoden naar het experimenteren met nieuwe, van financiële winst naar meervoudige waardecreatie.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Redesigning business</strong></p>
<p>Mapping, perspectiefwisseling, reframing en het kunnen verbinden van uiteenlopende stakeholders zijn bij uitstek vaardigheden die voor het reageren op complexe veranderingen relevant zijn. Social practices kunnen daar een waardevolle rol bij spelen. Twee aspecten zien we bij social practices nagenoeg overal terug: de introductie van de factor tijd in het ontwikkelproces en het centraal stellen van het bestaande – dat wil zeggen de mensen, netwerken, gebouwen, kennis, kunde, materialen en behoeftes die reeds voor handen zijn. In de social practices verbinden ontwerpers deze lokale krachten op zodanige wijze dat nieuwe perspectieven ontstaan, ze de tijd krijgen om deze stap voor stap te ontvouwen en een nieuwe visie op eigenaarschap en kapitaal de ruimte krijgt. Dat dat niet altijd eenvoudig is spreekt voor zich. Voor systeemverandering is een grote dosis geduld, lef en doorzettingsvermogen vereist. Ook improvisatievermogen, systeemanalyse en veranderkunde zijn daarbij van belang. Dit heeft tot gevolg dat ook het ontwerp- en kunstonderwijs verandert. In Den Haag is in 2011 de masteropleiding INSIDE gestart, op de Willem de Kooning Academie zijn de social practices één van de drie nieuwe, interdisciplinaire afstudeerprofiel geworden en in Eindhoven draait de master Social Design. Ook in het buitenland wordt deze omslag herkend: in Baltimore draait het Center for Social Design en in Budapest draait een EcoLab op the Moholy-Nagy University of Art &amp; Design. Al deze opleidingen gaan uit van de notie dat interdisciplinair werken een realiteit en veranderkunde een noodzaak is geworden om de gangbare praktijk te kunnen kantelen. Daar bestaat geen blauwdruk voor, gelukkig maar. Wat wel opvalt is een specifieke attitude. Een houding die idealen koppelt aan daad- en verbeeldingskracht mèt en ìn het hier en nu, zonder daarmee belerend of bevoogdend te zijn. Het is deze attitude die als een frisse wind een deel van de ontwerp-en kunstwereld op een ander spoor zet.</p>

A PROCESS JOURNAL (with discarded notes)

This is a disjointed diary of thoughts and my process. I had difficulties writing this research document because of the fear of being wrong. Writing it in this way, including preliminary notes that were later discarded, is an exercise in self-love, where I can uncover my vulnerability and authenticity by giving credence and space to what I think is not worthy of being read.

<h4 id="ii-introduction"><span id="II.29.09INTRODUCTION" class="mw-headline">II) INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p>I come from Curaçao, an island in the Caribbean, where I grew up in a bi-cultural household. That means I got to enjoy amazing Dominican ‘mangú’ and ‘sòpi di kabritu’ from Curaçao almost every weekend. It also meant growing up with difficulties in feeling I could be myself without having to assimilate, in order to fit in with the people around me. As I got older, I discovered my own sexual orientation as an attempt to classify it, same as I wanted to classify/pigeonhole my racial background.</p>
<p>Could I live life as a half-Dominican in Curacao? What side of my identity should I choose? As if I was only allowed to choose one over the other, sticking to the stereotypes of what it means to be Curaçaoan or Dominican. As the son of a Dominican and Curaçaoan, I found myself having a similar way of approaching my sexual orientation. I thought I’d have to choose between living life as a heterosexual or as a covert homosexual. Knowing very well that I thought that I would not have the courage to step up and confess my sexuality unless I’d move to another country or both my parents passed away. I began to internalize the heterosexism that was taught in my household. My self-worth began to become as absent as my sense of identity.</p>
<p>I’ve encountered many queer people of color whom share a similar story as mine. Parents usually react by feeling angry and ashamed, afraid of what others in the community are going to say and think. The church also plays a great part in what, more often than not, will be used as a backbone argument to declare queer sexuality sinful. It’s also not just about the coming out part but about moving forward after coming out, about how this milestone that supposedly sets you free isn’t a singular moment in your lifespan but a continuous struggle. In the view of intersectionality, there is a complex layering that makes queerness of color completely different from the white queer experience, specifically in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>“I think white gay people feel cheated because they were born, in principle, in a society in which they were supposed to be safe. The anomaly of their sexuality puts them in danger, unexpectedly. Their reaction seems to me in direct proportion to their sense of feeling cheated of the advantages, which accrue to white people in a white society. There’s an element, it has always seemed to me, of bewilderment and complaint. Now that may sound very harsh, but the gay world as such is no more prepared to accept black people than anywhere else in society. It’s a very hermetically sealed world with very unattractive features, including racism.”</p>
<p>Go the Way Your Blood Beats (Interview with James Baldwin) Richard Goldstein Voice, 1984</p>
<p>“Naar mijn ervaringen met zowel witte hetero mensen als niet-hetero mensen, verwacht ik geen verschil tussen de hoeveelheid racisme. Ik verwacht wel verschil in de manier waarop racisme tot uiting komt. Er bestaat namelijk (nog) geen sterke broeder/zusterschap die queer mensen, ongeacht etnische afkomst, verbindt. De loyaliteit ligt vaak elders.</p>
<p>Ik zal altijd zwart zijn, voordat ik als queer word gezien. Ook binnen de homogemeenschap. De invulling van wat zwart betekent voor een niet-zwart queer persoon, heeft gevolgen voor hoe zwarte queer mensen worden behandeld.”</p>
<p>Translation: In my experiences with both white straight people and non-heterosexual people, I do not expect a difference between the amount of racism. I do expect a difference in the way racism is expressed. There is not (yet) a strong brother / sisterhood that connects queer people, regardless of ethnic origin. Loyalty is often elsewhere.</p>
<p>I will always be black before I am seen as queer. Also within the gay community. The interpretation of what black means for a non-black queer person has consequences for how black queer people are treated.&quot;</p>
<p>Blog entry by Abdi Suleiman (January 17, 2018) Zwart en Queer in Nederland</p>
<p>Despite their violence, I appreciate all the intersections of oppression and exclusion that I have experienced. They have helped me to become compassionate.</p>
<p>I position myself as an Afro-Caribbean queer male artist in search of the queer history and lived experience of Curaçaoan people in The Netherlands. I will use the word queer in this document and in my work because of the historical weight it carries, which I will explain a little bit more later on. Also, because it’s a term that recognizes male, female, non-binary and gender non-conforming and trans lives.</p>
<p>For us—queer Curaçaoans in the Netherlands—I believe, it’s important to work on preserving, investigating, and making visible our queer past both in the once-colonized and former-colonizer landscapes.</p>

<p>I was curious to find out more about the gay liberation movement that had started in late 19th century Netherlands, as it was one of the earliest points in history where the queer community collectively fought for equal rights and against (legal) discrimination. Before this process began, homosexuality was seen as sodomy and punishable by law in Europe since the 13th century.</p>
<p>My first step into the field research was to find queer people of color in The Netherlands who had experienced the Gay Liberation movement first hand here.</p>
<p>There was no documentation I could easily access or knew where to find in the places where I was looking—Jstor, libraries in Rotterdam, online via Google search. What I did find were queer or black writers from the Netherlands, but none writing about the Afro-Caribbean history and experience. It became clear to me that I had to find people of color who were here during that time and had some sort of involvement with the liberation movement. I had to meet people who were willing to share their stories with me. In other words, I had to learn (by doing) how to collect oral narratives of past events and time periods.</p>
<p>Oral tradition was a critical tool for preservation of stories that would otherwise be lost from one generation to another, especially in precarious, underserved, at risk, or militant communities. Two quotes from sociologist Paul Thompson in The Voice of the Past Oral History:</p>
<p>“Mining and fishing communities are the classic subjects of this type of work.”</p>
<p>“Other historians have recorded life-stories with radical activists, ranging from British socialists to African Peasant Intellectuals. And in general, oral evidence can provide much missing information on the activities and attitudes of the rank and file of the parties: their reading, their social backgrounds and occupations and relationships.”</p>
<p>In an attempt to better understand what led to the start of the liberation movement in the late 1960s, then unified under term ‘gay’, I read the book Pijlen van naamloze liefde: Pioniers van de homo-emancipatie (Maurice Van Lieshout and Hans Hafkamp, 1988). While it extensively discussed the process of decriminalization for homosexuality during the late 19th century, it was only a vast collection of white actors who were given recognition as ‘pioneers’ in the book. Patrick Reinsborough and Doyle Canning wrote in about their understanding of the use of narratives to move people by creating bonds of mutual understanding.</p>
<p>“Narrative power analysis is based on the recognition that the currency of story is not truth, but meaning. That is, what makes a story powerful is not necessarily facts but how the story creates meaning in the hearts and minds of the listeners.”</p>

<p>Felix de Rooy (1952)</p>
<p>Felix de Rooy was someone I got to know through Glenn Helberg. Glenn was very proud of Felix and his achievements both here in The Netherlands and back home in Curaçao. I had arranged a meeting with him on Sunday in Amsterdam; he was the second person I was going to interview for this project. I had rented a camera, mic and tripod to set up at his home, where he was kind enough to invite me over for our talk. As walked through the doorway, he greeted me at the top of the stairs. I could barely see him in the darkness, couldn’t see what he was wearing. It was unsettling. He said one word. “Come.” And I did. As I walked into his apartment I immediately a feeling come over that this man was going to have a great impact on me. Before I could even start recording, he had already summarized his childhood experience on the island. And I couldn’t dare to stop him as he had a way of telling his story that felt unapologetic. He was secure about himself. Even though he has won many awards—for theater work, directing and writing movies—I realized I had not heard of him while growing up in Curaçao. I must say, my family wasn’t much supportive of the arts of any kind back then, so we weren’t part of any “bougie” circles that knew who he was. But he was an important staple in the theater and film scene on the island.</p>
<p>But then, another thought came up to me. Most successful or talented queer people from Curaçao are not that visible or audible (spoken about in public). Those who are most of the times are made fun of, because they also act comically. They might also be transgender but still classified or seen as gay.</p>
<p>I got to know that he was very encouraged to explore the arts from an early age by his parents, who were also art enthusiasts, and with that he developed a talent for speaking his mind. I really admired how he put his experiences as a queer man from Curaçao into his work . He wrote a theater play, Marival, around understanding the playful performativity of island drag queens. One of the things that stayed with me after this conversation was how he experienced going back to Curaçao after living in The Netherlands a couple of years. He returned to teach at a high school on the island. The first day of school, he was quickly made aware of how bizarre and mariku his outfit was by the students who had watched him pass by. He recalls that he actually had worn a very ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ inspired outfit, boots and all. He turned around on his pirate heels. To the group of boys who were still laughing, he said, in a very unsympathetic tone of voice, “Yes that’s right, I am gay. And I know that this won’t be a problem for us, will it?” This had an impact on the students. His response made it clear that he didn’t really care about being outed or even about being called mariku. He was in control, not ashamed of his sexuality. He became one of the teachers students came to if they wanted to understand about not just sexuality but also things like art or the world beyond the borders of Curaçao. I left, after spending almost the whole day there, feeling like I found a piece of history that I was supposed to know but never knew existed.</p>

<h6 id="kapitulo-dos"><span id="Kapitulo_Dos" class="mw-headline">Kapitulo Dos</span></h6>
<p>Glenn Helberg (1955)</p>
<p>Psychiatrist Glenn Helberg is a well-known activist from Curaçao. He was also one very important contact person for me during this search.</p>
<p>Meeting with Glenn was a bit difficult because of his busy agenda. We often ended having unplanned conversations through the phone while he rushed to a meeting or sat in a train on his way to the Tropen Museum. We ultimately arranged a meeting at his apartment in Amsterdam. We had to move things along quickly as he had another appointment planned right after ours. I asked him first about how his queer/gay sexuality had impacted his life as an immigrant to the Netherlands. It was difficult for me to follow his reasoning when he answered, he had a particular way of saying things without saying too much. He was holding information back, I had to find different ways to keep asking things. But from what I understood: His relationship with his sexuality was something he preferred to keep private while young. He wanted to cultivate intellectual pursuits, become highly educated, while leaving the exploration of his sexuality in the backseat until he felt mentally prepared to unpack it.</p>
<p>As a teenage boy he volunteered at the LGBT* association, COC, in Utrecht. There he was able to share parts of his experience with others. As an adult (according to him), he was one of the first openly gay black men in the Netherlands that had a baby with a close queer friend. I asked him multiple times if this was verifiable information. He responded that he and his close friend were interviewed for an article in a newspaper but protected their identity for personal reasons. He had a very proud look on his face and in the ring of his voice. He explained that the Gay Liberation movement happening at the end of the 1960s did not have much impact on him because he did not experience it in a close-contact way. “My liberation was a very personal experience, it was happening within my mind and my body, not by marching down the streets.” He said it was important for him to first reach the point of self-liberation before he could even think of liberation of the community. We also talked about the pressure of naming one’s sexuality. He personally preferred not using any labels. I noticed that this conversation was becoming more of a critical view on the queer community instead of his personal memories and history.</p>
<p>He then asked, “What does it mean for a young queer Curaçaoan to live in The Netherlands?” while looking straight at me for the answer. I said I sometimes do feel that the white queer experience has been the dominant one here and that I find little sources to relate my queer identity to.</p>
<p>He then asked, “How can it be that the current generation doesn’t know much about the previous one?” while offering the answer himself. He knew a lot of people from his generation who made trips to Curaçao, sharing the knowledge they gathered abroad with the younger generation there. He believed it was possible to transfer this knowledge as a way to create the same awareness of our rights that exists abroad. He believed that we, this current generation, could have more influence on the younger generation of queer Curaçaoans.</p>
<p>Secret garden parties also came up during our conversation. Apparently, they were by-invitation-only events held in in The Hague for queer people, most of them from the Caribbean. When pressed for more information, he kept holding back. Said he didn’t really go to those kinds of parties because they didn’t really appeal to him. Said he would bring me in contact with people who have more information on this topic.</p>
<p>ASTERISK NOTE: My preferred acronym is LGBTQIA+ when I’m not using the word queer but COC Netherlands still uses the LGBT version.</p>

<p>Amado (1957)</p>
<p>Through a neighborhood friend, about a year ago I got in contact with Amado. I quickly set up a meeting with him in Rotterdam, where he lives. Amado was born in Aruba. He was and still is very well known for his participation in various beauty pageants organized by and for queer people in the Caribbean. He moved to Curaçao in order to be closer to the friends he had made while doing pageantries. He won many of them, was treated like royalty in Aruba and Curaçao, and found himself many times in newspaper articles. At one point, he felt he had to live life as a transgender woman. He even changed his name from Amado to Amada. “It just felt like this is who I belonged to be,” he said, looking at an old newspaper article with his picture on it. He had framed the clippings he could save and placed them in a display cabinet. A few years ago, he decided Amada was no longer his true self. Some people still call him Amada, though.</p>
<p>Amado talked mostly about his youth, about beautiful summer romances, about all the times he almost got caught in bed with other men by his father. I asked him about his experience in The Netherlands. He told me he’s really sick, been sick for the last 10 years. He did not tell me exactly what was going on, but I didn’t mind not knowing. Because of his sickness, he lives in a apartment building together with other elderly and ill people, many nearing the end.</p>
<p>I said, “You don’t look that bad.”</p>
<p>He blushed for a little while and then placed a plate of food and a bottle of beer right under my nose, yelling, “I am with God! Dios ta kumi!” He stared at me. He waited for me to take the first bite of the meal he had just prepared. I wanted to talk. He wanted me to eat and drink beer.</p>
<p>Amado had been helping homeless people, drug addicts, queer Caribbean teenagers who were kicked out of their homes, and people who migrated from eastern European countries. He offered them food and place to stay at his house. The people he took in were only allowed to stay for two months; otherwise, he’d get irritated. But he did his best to help them find a way to their own home. He often got threatened by his neighbors and the coordinator of the building with being kicked out for giving shelter to people that were not allowed to stay there.</p>
<p>“I still do it. I’ll lie to them, say they’re my cousin or that I’m throwing a party and these are my guests, I don’t care!” It was difficult for him to say much more on the subject because right behind us, there were people sitting, his current ‘guests’, a man and a woman who looked Polish to me.</p>
<p>Before leaving, I told him that he needed to take care of his health and that I would see him again soon. I haven’t seen him again. Every time we tried to meet, he would cancel because he wasn’t feeling too well.</p>

<h4 id="v-nine-question-auto-interview"><span id="V.29.09NINE-QUESTION_AUTO-INTERVIEW" class="mw-headline">V) NINE-QUESTION AUTO-INTERVIEW</span></h4>
<p><strong>1. How difficult has it been to find sources written by people I can relate to about the experiences that I’m trying to represent?</strong></p>
<p>Queer people around the world have had difficulties concerning historical and cultural presence or, at the very least, documentation of it. In The Netherlands, the queer community as a whole had only started to work on their visibility in the late 19th century. It was challenging to find sources in the form of documents of people from Curaçao. It was important for me to find material from sources I could relate to. In the time I had available during this half year, I was able to find a few books and essays by scholars and authors who had researched the experience of queer people of color in The Netherlands. But none could I find that were specifically about people from Curaçao—or any other island with a Dutch colonial past. I did not see it as failure but as testament to what I already suspected about our (in)visibility and (mis)representation within The Netherlands. I did however get a chance to read what I felt were sources similar to what I was looking for. They were about Surinamese and Moroccan communities (Verboden liefde: Familie en homoseksualiteit in de Surinaamse gemeenschap by Sandew Hira, Gewurgd door taboes: Veranderingen in de acceptatie van homoseksualiteit onder Surinaams Hindustanen in Nederland by Anita C. Nanhoe and Jurriaan Omlo) and black queer men in the United Kingdom (Black and Gay in the UK - An Anthology by John R. Gordon and Rikki Beadle-Blair). They were able to give me some insight into the experience of the queer community in relation to colonialist countries. I still felt like I was left with an exposed gap that needed filling with Curaçaoan queerness, people that are living or had lived in the Netherlands when they were young adults. This might mean they had more freedom to live and explore their sexuality than when they were still underage, not negating that they might have had this experience during their younger years in Curaçao as well.</p>
<p><em>DISCARDED NOTE: Why aren’t these stories told? How can we protect our Caribbean queer cultural heritage? Where does it belong?</em></p>
<p>For me to do this work of filling, I had to come in contact with a larger network through organizations like The Black Archives, Vereniging Ons Suriname, and the newly created LGBTQIA+ peer-coaching group at the Hogeschool Rotterdam. I would visit these places in search of any documents, books, or films that they could have saved, while using this opportunity to have one-on-one conversations with the people working there. I told them about my search effort and why it is of value for me and for better representation of the community. They responded by introducing me to people they thought would help me move forward in my project.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>2. Who is the ideal audience for this work?</strong></p>
<p>The ideal audience for my work, first of all,* would have to be the locals of Curaçao and the diaspora here in The Netherlands. I wasn’t looking to find people of color from Curaçao exclusively. Like I’ve stated before, I am well aware that when speaking of people of color living in the Netherlands, I am referring to a larger African diaspora.</p>
<p>ASTERISK NOTE: During my teenage years in highschool we were taught to use ter eerste, ten tweede, (first of all, second of all), etc… in order to give our Dutch essays more credibility and an official, important feel. We would have to use these techniques to show we were knowledgeable in Dutch. If you knew how to say these words, you were perceived as knowing how to speak Dutch.</p>
<p><em>DISCARDED NOTE: How intelligible do I want to be for those who are not able to see my surroundings the way I see it, the way I live it?</em></p>
<p><br />
<strong>3. Is it possible or advisable to transfer lived experiences/embodied wisdom from the diaspora to the homeland without translation?</strong></p>
<p>We not only have to look at better the representation of the queer diaspora of Curaçao in The Netherlands but also find critically the best way to translate this to the locals on the homeland. The lived experiences/embodied wisdom from the diaspora should never be literally relocated and placed in the context of Curaçao, but used as a way to have a dialogue with, first the queer community of the island to see where there is possibility to grow in their own experiences and what they believe is important for them to have as part of the community of Curaçao. Then it’s also of importance that they can have these kinds of dialogues with the rest of the community. These events would be necessary in order to talk about the bigger issues embedded within the culture that are not always made available to discuss because it’s been made easier to blame all things wrong to the seemingly weakest or seen sinful according to religious system that holds the cultural values in place. Belle Hooks stated in her essay ‘Understanding Patriarchy’:</p>
<p>“Psychotherapist John Bradshaw’s clear-sighted definition of patriarchy in Creating Love is a useful one: ‘The dictionary defines ‘patriarchy’ as a ‘social organization marked by the supremacy of the father in the clan or family in both domestic and religious functions’.” Patriarchy is characterized by male domination and power. He states further that ‘patriarchal rules still govern most of the world’s religious, school systems, and family systems.’ Describing the most damaging of these rules, Bradshaw lists ‘blind obedience—the foundation upon which patriarchy stands; the repression of all emotions except fear; the destruction of individual willpower; and the repression of thinking whenever it departs from the authority figure’s way of thinking.’ Patriarchal thinking shapes the values of our culture. We are socialized into this system, females as well as males. Most of us learned patriarchal attitudes in our family of origin, and they were usually taught to us by our mothers. These attitudes were reinforced in schools and religious institutions.”</p>
<p>This can be related to my work in the way that this social organization plays a very important role in the cultural archive and with that the consciousness of the inhabitants of Curaçao. There’s this chauvinistic idea that preserves dominance and excludes any seemingly weak characteristics to the male person. A group of researchers of the Western Carolina University in the US suggest that men who use sexist and anti-gay humour do so to reaffirm their own sense of self, particularly when they feel their masculinity is being threatened. Study author Emma O’Connor explained:</p>
<p><br />
“Men higher in precarious manhood beliefs expressed amusement with sexist and anti-gay humour in response to a masculinity threat because they believe it reaffirms an accurate, more masculine impression of them. It appears that by showing amusement with sexist and anti-gay humour, such men can distance themselves from the traits they want to disconfirm,”</p>
<p>Restoring Threatened Masculinity: The Appeal of Sexist and Anti-Gay Humor</p>
<p><br />
This experiment was conducted on 166 heterosexual men and limited to residents of the United States. There were 110 (66%) Whites, 19 (11%) African-Americans, 11 (7%) Hispanics, 20 (12%) Asians, 3 (2%) Native American and 3 (2%) people who self-identified as other. This could serve an indication of in the diaspora here in The Netherlands. Which is why this work is necessary in order to share what the lived experiences are of the queer people of Curaçao.</p>
<p><em>DISCARDED NOTE: I often felt like I still had to assimilate to what would be accepted even though I was now in a country where it was allowed. Assimilation in order to not feel ashamed because a majority of the community here, either descendant of or have migrated from the Caribbean, would still judge our sexuality and judge it as something we should be ashamed of.</em></p>
<p><br />
<strong>4. Some of the people that I interviewed expressed how they wanted to transfer their experience of acceptance here in The Netherlands back home to the Caribbean, is that what I want to do now?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the people that I interviewed spoke about when they were younger and went back to the island. They tried to transfer the experience of acceptance that they had achieved to a certain extent here in The Netherlands. They created a small zine called Bolletin in cooperation with Grupo Homofilia Antiyano. Their intentions:</p>
<p>&quot;om voorlichting te geven en een bijdrage te leveren aan een open samenleving door taboes bespreekbaar te maken.&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Dolly Bellefleur</code></pre>
<p>Translation: ‘to provide information and to contribute to an open society by making taboos open to discussion.’</p>
<p>This is not necessarily what I want to achieve with my work. Transfer is different from translate. Taboos are interwoven within the existing culture in each place. What works in one side doesn’t necessarily work in another. Either way, I see this work as the first step to a long process of understanding, self-discovery and making space for dialogues between queer Curaçaoans and also the non-queer community in Curaçao and The Netherlands.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>5. Why did I choose to present my work as a performance?</strong></p>
<p>I have recently reconnected myself with the power of the performance. I find it extremely interesting how it can be used as a device to translate narratives.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why people of color find the medium of performance a powerful way to show hidden/subliminal feelings, in ways that words on paper alone cannot do. It’s a shared cultural understanding (or myth) of the people from Curaçao that we express ourselves through performance. A large part of the culture is to celebrate the heritage. This is visible for example during Carnival and the Seu season.</p>
<p>There are two parts to the performance. One version has been previously recorded and will be displayed on four old school television sets. These four TVs will be placed on stools and will stand on both sides of where the performer will be placed live during the final exam and the graduation show.</p>
<p>The performance for Kas di mariku is about the youngest generation of queer Curaçaoans, both locals and diaspora, who are told the stories of our queer predecessors. While hearing about these experiences, the performer will tenderly begin covering himself with glitter. He first begins with his arms and continues to his upper body. Every new part of his body he reaches is making him realize how, the more stories he’s exposed to, the more visible he becomes. Each story makes him feel a different part of what it means to explore his queer sexual identity. At times, he feels completely in tune with his masculinity while at the same time curiously exploring the realm of femininity and all that lies between these two binaries. There’s still visible hold-back in his experience, he has to advance every step with caution because what lies ahead is still somewhat uncertain and unknown.</p>
<p>As time passes by and the stories keep coming in, he starts to mouth the same words of the stories that are being told. These stories are rooting themselves into his consciousness; creating connections with his own personal experiences he previously was unaware of there existence.</p>
<p>In the end, the performer will be completely covered in glitter, giving him a second layer of visibility. This new visibility was created with the help of past stories but placed by his conscious ability.</p>
<p><em>DISCARDED NOTE: It was visible while talking to the elders that there were hesitant with how much of their personal stories they were willing to share. Exchange of personal memories allowed for the fear to dissolve.</em></p>

<p><strong>6. Do I think it’s possible for the queer community to reclaim the word ‘mariku’?</strong></p>
<p>Saying the word mariku leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. And every time I hear it being said out loud in my vicinity I sometimes have an immediate response and start nervously looking around for who had fired this bullet out into the open like tha. Mariku is still predominantly used as a homophobic slur, the equivalent of the word faggot in English or mietje in Dutch. To understand the word mariku and the weight it carries, it is important to understand where it actually came from. The word itself has its roots set in the Spanish language. On the blog El Observatorio GLTB under the post ‘Etimología de “Maricón”’ translation: Etymology of “Maricón”</p>
<p>“En ese origen, “Maria”, está el origen de la asociación de “marica” con lo femenino. Pero el desprecio proviene de la descripción asociada a la palabra que es “varón que se comporta como una mujer”, o “varón que ha abandonado su conducta social masculina para comportarse como una mujer”.</p>
<p>La connotación de desprecio encuentra su fuente en que una persona nacida varón haya adoptado comportamientos no del sexo opuesto, sino del sexo inferior. El problema se encuadra claramente en la perspectiva de género: lo masculino es considerado superior; lo femenino es considerado inferior. El marica es despreciado porque siendo Mario, se porta como María: porque , teniendo el derecho de nacimiento a ser superior, decide parecerse a lo inferior. Por ello se los sindica como despreciables e incluso moralmente culpable.”</p>
<p>Translation: “In that origin, ‘Maria’, is the origin of the association of ‘marica’ with the feminine. But contempt comes from the description associated with the word that is ‘a man who behaves like a woman,’ or ‘a man who has abandoned his male performativity social behavior to behave like a woman.’</p>
<p>The connotation of contempt finds its source in that a person born male has adopted behaviors not of the opposite sex, but of the inferior sex. The problem is clearly framed in the gender perspective: the masculine is considered superior; the feminine is considered inferior. The sissy is despised because, being Mario, he behaves like María: because, having the right to be superior, he decides to resemble the inferior. That is why they are syndicated as despicable and even morally guilty.”</p>
<p>I, same as many others queers that have lived our lives speaking Papiamentu, have learned that a few words like this one could make you feel unsafe and insecure in an instant or defensive in an attempt to secure one’s macho cover-up. Recently, the word has been through some changes in cultural meaning where calling someone mariku is not necessarily exposing or conforming the queer sexuality of its receiver but more or less a term of endearment that friends, both cisgender and queer, use to call each other out for not being direct, for copping out.</p>
<p>It definitely did not erase the context of being effeminate or weak or something a heterosexual Curaçaoan man wouldn’t want to be defined as. I’ve seen it happen before when communities are able to reclaim words that are demeaning or hurtful and make others realize the impact it has on the person being called that word.</p>
<p>Yusuf Tamanna (June 19 2018) stated in the think piece “When did we start referring to ourselves as queer?” on i-D:</p>
<p>“Its reclamation began in the 1960s. In America, the gay rights movement had begun. Many of its activists identified as queer in an act of defiance and resilience to police brutality.”</p>
<p>In 1990 when Queer Nation—an LGBTQIA+ organization founded by AIDS activists— was born in New York, they released pamphlet during the pride that year called Queers Read This, which created the initiative to reclaim the word queer. It challenged: “Well, yes, ‘gay’ is great. It has its place. But when a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we've chosen to call ourselves queer. Using ‘queer’ is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world. It's a way of telling ourselves we don't have to be witty and charming people who keep our lives discreet and marginalised in the straight world. We use queer as gay men loving lesbians and lesbians loving being queer. Queer, unlike GAY, doesn't mean MALE.”</p>
<p>I am aware that in this particular case were are dealing with a different set of cultural rules, social constructs and ways that the community can excuse most of the horrible things that happen to us and turn it into comedy, making fun of something we actually all know is hurtful. But before we get to the point where the queer community that speaks Papiamentu is able to reclaim the word mariku, there are certain things that would have to happen. One of them is to understand the leading role that patriarchal masculinity that plays in the culture of Curaçao.</p>
<p><em>DISCARDED NOTE: I get a weird feeling every time I start to tell someone about my personal life. I am not ashamed of being queer person of color or for being a queer parent, I just cringe every time someone says something like, ‘Well, I don’t know any Curaçaoan gay couple here in The Netherlands that have foster kids, do you?’</em></p>
<p><br />
<strong>7. How important is it to me that the rest of the audience (non-Afro-Caribbean/Curaçaoans) fully understand my work?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t believe that by making the work completely understandable for everyone else that is not from Curaçao is of importance. There is power in knowing that I can direct it towards those who I know can understand it. As an artist of the diaspora,I’d like to make visible things that for many years were difficult to understand, and still are because there was little to no space for it to be explored, brought to the eyes of those that had needed most to see it. I’m afraid that, in my effort of making it clear for the audience of this exhibition at WdKA, I might lose the connection to those whom the work is actually for.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>8. Where do I think is the ideal natural habitat for this work in terms of exhibition space?</strong></p>
<p>This work would fit best if it were placed in an environment where it would more directly reach the Curaçaoan diaspora with a heteronormative view on sexuality. I’ve thought of a few possible places where they would come together like at the barbershops, toko’s, and Caribbean restaurants. Also, during events where we celebrate our cultural background like for example the Summer Carnival. It could serve as an opportunity where time and space would be safely and carefully created for dialogues about the queer community. I want to go beyond the idea of you can be mariku if you want as long as you don’t bring that near me.</p>
<p>“Bo por ta mariku si bo ke, biba bo bida, pero basta bo no bini akibandanan mes.”</p>
<p>It might be seen at first as if I am trying to produce a bad response, like poking the bear—or in this case the heterosexual black man, even woman. But creating this confrontation it would affirm that homosexuality is still something the cis-community does not want to embrace. Bringing this forward would perhaps be the first step in allowing a process of change. What is seen can be addressed.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>9. If the ideal audience is not the audience seeing this exhibition,</strong> does this work still have value?</p>
<p>Considering the time, resources and connections I have available at the moment, while I’m graduating I’ve decided that I would much rather focus temporarily on the placement of this work in the graduation show at the WdKA. I’m aware that the audience this work is actually for would not be the audience attending the graduation show. But even in this case, this work is also of relevance for those who are not part of the Afro-Caribbean queer community. I want to broaden the perspective of the queer discourse, which here in The Netherlands is dominated by the white queer narrative. It is of even more relevance for those who are part of the queer community here to see the same issues from another lens with its own experiences and discourse.</p>

<h4 id="vi-conclusion"><span id="VI.29.09CONCLUSION" class="mw-headline">VI) CONCLUSION</span></h4>
<p>Reflecting upon my experience the last couple of months, I can recall how I initially sought out to produce evidence of Curaçaoan queer participation in the face of historical and cultural absence here in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>The lack of documentation on the non-white queer Dutch community from the early beginnings of the Gay Liberation movement have reasons as simple as “meetings were not advertised” or “there was no organization besides the COC Netherlands who was producing culture.” The lack of primary and secondary sources also made the search for these poorly visible actors, keepers of important oral narratives, even more difficult.</p>
<p>With the people and the stories that I was able to find I want to create a better understanding for the queer generation of our collective past. We have now moved forward in terms of visibility and equal rights, compared to the 60s and 70s when Felix de Rooy, Glenn Helberg and Amado were exploring their own liberation within their limitations in The Netherlands. Understanding and acceptance remain two very important points for me to strive towards if we want to broaden perspective of the white queer and cisgender community here.</p>
<p>With my work, I’d like to start the dialogue with others of the queer Curaçaoan community to discuss the use of the word mariku. We could understand why certain things should change and why certain things remain the same in our social behavior. Words like mariku that only serve to divide us even more into unequal power structures.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Looking critically back at the results so far, there are a few things that I would’ve liked to do differently. Six months ago, I was moving in a (familiar) landscape that was almost unknown to me. It’s clear now that I need to dig deeper for theoretical knowledge that would help me unravel or/and continue building on these intricate Curaçaoan queer life stories.</p>
<p>This is a project I intend to continue working on. I have met a few people in the time that was available, but I know that this process takes much more time in a much bigger scale, tackling a variety of different subjects. For now, this is the first stepping-stone to continue moving further after graduation.</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, the natural habitat for my work is in a Curaçaoan Barbershop. It is in this space that it would be tested against the cultural norms of the Curaçao straight male. This experience would be documented and make room for dialogue.</p>

Review of a videoclip highlighting the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia. Something that is not accepted in that culture.
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>author: Maud Dik</p>
<p>“Hwages” or in English, “ Concerns”.<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38520492" class="external autonumber">[1]</a> Was Posted on Youtube December 23th. The video is created by media production company 8ies. The video has around 7 million views since it has been uploaded on Youtube. What is so special about this videoclip? The videoclip has been made by a Saudi Arabia located company, this is not weird or special. What special is, is that the content in the videoclip highlights the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia. Something that is not accepted in that culture. Neither is that women drive, swim in public pools, work out in gyms, enter cemeteries, browse fashion magazines, open their own bank account, file for divorce, wear anything other than an abaya in public, and so on. Women aren’t aloud to do much in that country. Yet all these things that I just named are the things this video clip makes fun of.</p>

<h4 id="about-the-videoclip"><span id="About_the_videoclip" class="mw-headline">About the videoclip</span></h4>
<p>The women are playing basketball, skating, breaking out in dance, and rinding in some bumper cars. The only men that are featured in this video clip are the driver, which is a little boy, two disapproving official types and a Donald Trump cutout <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/womens-rights-saudi-arabia-viral-feminist-pop-song-music-video-calls-end-men-watch-2468707" class="external autonumber">[3]</a>. By showing these men in the video, they show how ridiculous the rights are for women. They show that even a little boy has more rights by let him driving the car but women don’t. Donald Trump is in the video probably because these days he is strict on women rights and cuts them down. The producers want to show that there are similarities in the way trump thinks about women and the way Saudi Arabia think of women. The lyrics that is sung in the clip can be translated to “ May all men be erased as they’ve given us mental illness” and “ If only God would rid us of men”. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/04/middleeast/saudi-song-women/" class="external autonumber">[4]</a> These are some confronting sentences but are a good and direct way of letting people, especially in their home country , know how sick and tired they are of the male-dominated society in Saudi Arabia. it expresses women’s frustration. Something i really like about this clip. It may be controversial but it shows the direct messages and you can’t look away from it. you can’t also interpret it differently.</p>
<h5 id="opinions"><span id="Opinions" class="mw-headline">Opinions</span></h5>
<p>By the controversiality of this videoclip there are also a lot of people whom have an opinion on this project. The reactions are very diverse if you look at the comments on the Youtube page. They differ from &quot;The video clip is beautiful. With all the comedy, it shows one aspect of oppression girls are subjected to.&quot; to &quot;Unbelievable video clip!! The voice is bad and the content is worse.. Imagine the girls drive (cars) and men are dressed like that and dance. May Allah protect us.&quot; but also &quot;Foreign newspapers are mentioning it. Creatives - let the world know that there are talented people who appreciate art in Saudi Arabia. It is not all about religious police, clerics IS members and retardation.&quot;</p>
<p>The diversity of these comments is something i really like about this project. People start talking about it, it starts a cultural discussion without intention.</p>

How they do this is very professional. they show it by the visuals but also with the songtekst. they have thought of the many sides of a videoclip and how it could communicate best. They could have chosen for images of women but instead they use “real life” women who are acting in the activities.

<p>“Hwages” or in English, “ Concerns”.<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38520492" class="external autonumber">[6]</a> Was Posted on Youtube December 23th. The video is created by media production company 8ies. The video has around 7 million views since it has been uploaded on Youtube. What is so special about this videoclip? The videoclip has been made by a Saudi Arabia located company, this is not weird or special. What special is, is that the content in the videoclip highlights the oppression of women in Saudi Arabia. Something that is not accepted in that culture. neither is that women drive, swim in public pools, work out in gyms, enter cemeteries, browse fashion magazines, open their own bank account, file for divorce, wear anything other than an abaya in public, and so on. Women aren’t aloud to do much in that country. Yet all these things that I just named are the things this video clip makes fun of <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/irl/saudi-women-break-stereotypes-music-video/" class="external autonumber">[7]</a>.</p>

<h4 id="about-the-videoclip-1"><span id="About_the_videoclip_2" class="mw-headline">About the videoclip</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>
<p>The women are playing basketball, skating, breaking out in dance, and rinding in some bumper cars. The only men that are featured in this video clip are the driver, which is a little boy, two disapproving official types and a Donald Trump cutout <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/womens-rights-saudi-arabia-viral-feminist-pop-song-music-video-calls-end-men-watch-2468707" class="external autonumber">[8]</a>. By showing these men in the video, they show how ridiculous the rights are for women. They show that even a little boy has more rights by let him driving the car but women don’t. Donald Trump is in the video probably because these days he is strict on women rights and cuts them down. The producers want to show that there are similarities in the way trump thinks about women and the way Saudi Arabia think of women. The lyrics that is sung in the clip can be translated to “ May all men be erased as they’ve given us mental illness” and “ If only God would rid us of men”. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/04/middleeast/saudi-song-women/" class="external autonumber">[9]</a> These are some confronting sentences but are a good and direct way of letting people, especially in their home country , know how sick and tired they are of the male-dominated society in Saudi Arabia. it expresses women’s frustration. Something i really like about this clip. It may be controversial but it shows the direct messages and you can’t look away from it. you can’t also interpret it differently.</p>
<h5 id="opinions-1"><span id="Opinions_2" class="mw-headline">Opinions</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h5>
<p>By the controversiality of this videoclip there are also a lot of people whom have an opinion on this project. The reactions are very diverse if you look at the comments on the Youtube page. They differ from &quot;The video clip is beautiful. With all the comedy, it shows one aspect of oppression girls are subjected to.&quot; to &quot;Unbelievable video clip!! The voice is bad and the content is worse.. Imagine the girls drive (cars) and men are dressed like that and dance. May Allah protect us.&quot; but also &quot;Foreign newspapers are mentioning it. Creatives - let the world know that there are talented people who appreciate art in Saudi Arabia. It is not all about religious police, clerics IS members and retardation.&quot;</p>
<p>The diversity of these comments is something i really like about this project. People start talking about it, it starts a cultural discussion without intention.</p>
<p>It has been produced and created only by men, so when i first found out I kind of thought it was weird. In a country where the men has so many rights and power. why would they make something so specific critical on those rights and powers they posses. The only thing 8ies studio co founder wanted to say about this production is &quot;We are a creative company that produces entertainment videos through social media platforms.”<a href="http://www.8iess.com" class="external autonumber">[10]</a> I don’t know if they intended to make such a controversial entertainment video but I think the fact that it are men whom made this, fully contributes to the message that it publicize.</p>

<p>Exactitudes</p>
<p>Photographer Ari Versluis and profiler Ellie Uyttenbroek have worked together since October 1994. Inspired by a shared interest in the striking dress codes of various social groups, they have systematically documented numerous identities over the last 21 years. Rotterdam’s heterogeneous, multicultural street scene remains a major source of inspiration for Ari Versluis and Ellie Uyttenbroek, although since 1998 they have also worked in many cities abroad.</p>
<p>They call their series Exactitudes: a contraction of exact and attitude. By registering their subjects in an identical framework, with similar poses and a strictly observed dress code, Versluis and Uyttenbroek provide an almost scientific, anthropological record of people’s attempts to distinguish themselves from others by assuming a group identity. The apparent contradiction between individuality and uniformity is, however, taken to such extremes in their arresting objective-looking photographic viewpoint and stylistic analysis that the artistic aspect clearly dominates the purely documentary element. (Exactitudes website – about, <a href="http://www.exactitudes.com/index.php?/about/" class="uri" class="external free">http://www.exactitudes.com/index.php?/about/</a>)</p>
<p>If we look at the project it’s quite clear that it’s a social project. The aspects of cultural diversity are strongly there and are the main goal of Exaxctitudes. To see if it’s a good social art we need to define ‘social art’. “Social practice is an art medium that focuses on social engagement, inviting collaborations with individuals, communities, and institutions in the creation of participatory art.” (Wikipedia, Social practice) is one of the definitions of social practice (art). If we put the project, Exactitudes, besides this definition we can see the similarity between them. Exactitudes is focussing on individuals who think they’re not part of a group while, in fact, they’re part of a dress code kind of group. This result is perfectly visualized in pictures that are put together to make a page full of the “same” people. I think the strong aspects are in the design. Because every page is designed the same it looks like you are looking at the same picture over and over again, however, you see so many different people. Also the same position for the same dress code works really well. It exaggerates that these people are dressed the same. I find it really interesting that because of these things you really get to know as if you know the people and know how they are as person. While you only see their outside and probably the least important thing about themselves. The design works beautifully by this idea and attitude. You feel like you’ve made contact with the people that are on the pictures. Also they exposed it in the MOTI museum in Breda and you could make your own group or place yourself in an already existing group. Or you could drag yourself in the ‘I’m special, there is nobody like me’ group, but I thought that was lame. I think you should leave it up to 10 groups and you just need to fit. That would be a cool project. Instead of always keeping yourself out of the main groups. Try to fit in and see how it feels.</p>
<p>What I would have changed is maybe done a bit of taboo breaking. Like the naked people and maybe some people that are already pushed in a square and make it even bigger so you would get a heavy discussion. That would make the book bigger and maybe it would get in the news. It would be discussed over a larger group and maybe we could break things like cultural diversity. Not that you can break something so big this easily but it would be a great starter point. Right now the book and pictures are left aside and almost no one knows about it, which I think is bad. It’s a funny way to look at different people that are actually the same in some kind of way.</p>

<div class="about">
Climate change is one of the most urgent issue that we are currently facing. It is a catalyst that sets off a train of demographic instabilities resulting in global conflicts over natural resources, which, in turn, will lead up to social inequalities, ethnic frictions, war zones, and degraded living conditions. In the near decades, even the most affluent societies will be deeply affected, as we are already seeing a surge in migration and social exclusion as well as a growing distrust in the validity of politics, corporates and institutions.
<p>Both Willem de Kooning Academy, University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam and Moholy Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest (MOME) have put social challenges at the core of their trajectories. Attention is focused on societal complexities that entail major cases for teachable issues that are indisputably relevant for our curricula. Societal complexities are notably abundant in the dynamics of climate change. It is broadly recognized that they cover a wide range of challenges, on a scale that quickly becomes difficult to comprehend. We therefore zoom in on local, incremental developments that are exemplar of worldwide incongruities.</p>
<p>Societal complexities are embedded in a long-range program in which interdisciplinary is key. How to educate students for facing the societal complexities of climate change? How to create a learning environment that accounts for a need for empowerment, agency, self-efficacy and resilience of those who will suffer most? How to educate accordingly? What is the purpose of design and design education in this arena?</p>
In this interactive break-out session our students will share their findings and dreams as next future’s protagonists in parallel sessions. Feel free to join their search for impact!

Workshop Impression

<p>What Design Can Do launched a ‘climate action challenge’, stating that (summarized): “Climate change is already here. We shouldn’t just focus on renewables and preventing CO2 outputs, we have to prepare for what disruptions the climate has in store for us.” It’s been widely recognized that the so called “refugee crisis” is in big part due to the effects of climate change. One domino piece falling and setting in motion other pieces that continue to fall until civilized society ceases to exist and people are forced to flee their homes. This crisis was actually the topic of the previous ‘what design can do’ challenge, so besides just that one crisis apparently now the focus is on all the other adverse effects of climate change as well. (That’s not to say that we shouldn’t also keep trying to keep the earth from “tipping” the dreaded 2 degrees that will set in course a runaway greenhouse effect and make our planet more like Venus that like Earth. #existentialcrisis)</p>
<p>If we look back in history there has definitely been real concern for the climate change problem, at least since the 80s. But even though we saw it coming we were not able to prevent it. Just like we couldn’t “prevent” Facebook from becoming the dominant social media platform that we don’t necessarily like (pun intended) but also nearly can’t do without- like we can’t do without the comforts of a fossil fueled economy. The problem is in short: we thought we could change the outcome, while we kept playing the same game.</p>
<p>What has changed is that these kind of topics are now more actively being taught in schools than in the 80s. More than ever, there is a need to mentor our future leaders (students) on the urgency for inclusion, empowerment, self-efficacy and resilience. Things that aren’t self evident when merely learning a profession. That said, we shouldn’t only focus on the symptoms of climate change. You have to be aware of the complex interplay of politics, technology, environmental science, design and markets, consumer behaviors, etc. Because just trying to solve one part of the problem will not change the complete system. But then again, trying to teach all that in one curriculum is also madness.</p>
<p>So how do we educate our students to become gamechangers while dealing with this complex interplay at multiple levels? That was we wanted to find out together with the more or less 50 participants at our session at What Design Can Do. During the event, 4 groups of students from different social practices who worked on different assignments, each gave a presentation on their projects and were questioned by our participants on the process they had during their courses and how that stood in relation to the education they were given. After that we actually asked the students themselves to tell us how we should better educate them. This is what we got (here is the gold):</p>
<p>The students told us that in hindsight they appreciated very much being brought out of their comfort zones because it opened up their eyes. This is for example what we try to do when we pair them up with local people in Rotterdam as part of their assignments. But it also involved having to dive into subjects they knew nothing about previously or weren’t part of their own discipline.</p>
<p>In relation to this the need for discussion, open conversations, was expressed. Social topics, unsurprisingly, require a debate. Not just from teacher to student, but students amongst themselves. Teachers have to step back as a source of information and start acting more as a facilitator that helps students learn together. As said, politics, are a player in the grand scheme of things, and the students became really aware that they didn’t speak the “political language” yet. In fact, learning different languages, not only national but also contextual or professional jargon, is a must for being able to dive in deeper and connect the creative profession to the governmental.</p>
<p>A feeling often felt is that a student project finishes and remains just a good idea but never goes further than that unless a student decides to pursue it herself/himself. Connecting those ideas to the market, actually testing it with people and working out a business plan should be a part of their projects. Then again, we have to stay cautious that we don’t keep playing the same game. Sometimes their projects do not immediately catch on simply because they are challenging the status quo. That also raises the question of when such a project is actually a success. How do you measure that people’s attitudes have changed because of this project and/or the positive side-effects that might occur because of it? At least a lot of knowledge is usually created in these projects and we pay more attention that this knowledge is transferrable so that other people can pick it up. That is also an interesting new concept within the creative industry because it changes how we look at ownership. It challenges the position of autonomous or commercial artists that previously still felt they needed to own the intellectual property to make a living.</p>
<p>Summing up it seems like we need to rethink the question. Can you actually “educate” a gamechanger? A gamechanger challenges authority (that’s us, the teachers) and changes the rules. She/he therefore creates new ways of being, living, consuming, doing politics, technology, and so forth through her/his practice. So perhaps... we replace “educate” with “make room for”.</p>

<td>Leaping Forward: The challenges and opportunities for education in the emergent field of design for social innovation</td>
<td>A new generation of designers is emerging committed to applying their creative talents to address the critical, “wicked” social and environmental challenges of our time. An increasing number of educational institutions have responded by offering interdisciplinary educational opportunities for designers to develop the awareness and skills they need to pursue professional opportunities in the field and approach complex social problems empathically, systematically and collaboratively.
<p>But what are the professional pathways for young designers pursuing careers in design for social innovation after graduation? And is design education preparing designers with the skills necessary to succeed in social innovation careers in this challenging and evolving marketplace? In April 2016, the Center for Social Design at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) is hosting the second convening of the LEAP Symposium to further evolve strategies for advancing professional pathways in design for social innovation. This article will reflect on the conversations from the LEAP/2: Value of Design Symposium and outline some of the challenges and opportunities facing design education in the emergent field of design for social innovation.</p></td>

<td>Designers, get beyond ‘raising awareness’</td>
<td>On February 4, the public event Beyond Social Night: redesigning the process took place. Best practices of interdisciplinary student projects on fast fashion, health care, refugees and wheelchair users took center stage. The underlying goal of the night was to investigate the processes behind these projects on social art and design. What is the intention of this generation designers? What are they aiming for? Is their methodology in line with their goals? And is the educational system consistent with their needs?
<p>The shown best practices all act on a shared value: empathy. The designers engage with a certain social issue and want to raise awareness of the problems, challenges and opportunities linked with this issue. But ‘raising awareness’ is just the first step of the designers’ intentions. They explicitly want to do more. Their prime goal is to have a transformative impact on society with regard to the issue they’re discussing. Simply put: they want to add value.</p>
<p>The intentions of the projects are with no exception honorable. The problem is that almost none of the designers seem to get beyond the first step of ‘raising awareness’. With exception of the project RAID, each of the best practices triggers the question what the follow-up will be. If adding value or transforming (a part of) society is your goal, you need to generate credible proof that your design proposal is provoking the desired implications. Without this proof, the impact of the project is only based on assumptions and, therefore, questionable.</p>
<p>So, when ‘having impact’ is the main goal of a social art project, it is import to know what kind of impact is being achieved. Therefore, it is needed that designers apply tools or methodologies that reveal what the impact of a project exactly is. It is not necessary to invent a totally new methodology. Suitable methods and tools can be found in examining working processes of other (academic) research disciplines. In this, the educational system can play an important role.</p></td>

<td>Embedded Research</td>
<td>em⋅bed⋅ded /imbedid/
<p>adjective</p>
<p>1 inserted as an integral part of a surrounding whole • confused by the embedded Latin quotations • an embedded subordinate clause</p>
<p>2 enclosed firmly in a surrounding mass • found pebbles embedded in the silt • stone containing many embedded fossils • peach and plum seeds embedded in a sweet edible pulp</p>
<p>(WoordBook.com)</p>
<p><br />
Why embedded research? Within the Social Practices at the WdKA, we encourage students to go into the reality of the city; with everything that this reality brings along. We want the students to develop through artistic (thus not scientific) research in the local context, to analyze informal networks, build relationships with strangers, collaborate with stakeholders, establish platforms, organize events etc. A mouthful. This is part of the new type of designer that the academy wants to educate; the Creative Pioneer, the Game Changer.</p>
<p>Seeking a stronger interaction with society, we need to develop other tools and working methods, than what a student would normally learn at an art academy. What we at the academy call the social practice is far away from the isolation and autonomy of the artists attic. Working embedded you meet ungovernable contexts, with unpredictable dynamics: residents who won’t open the door, who don’t stick to made agreements, who don’t respond how you expected, suddenly turning angry, fearful or extremely intimate - in short; working embedded you become part of something you can not control - and our challenge at the Wdka is to teach the student to position them selves in this dynamic.</p></td>

<div class="about">
During the last few years, a number of conservative actions in the US and Russia led to a surge of protests for more inclusive spaces, for racial, sexual and gender identities. Examples of such events are the prohibition of rainbows in Russia and the proposed ban of transgender military personnel by U.S. President Donald Trump. Given these tensions, safety becomes an important issue in social art and design.
<p>How do we ensure safe spaces where individual identity can flourish, regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation? How can we create a dialogue in which we enable such a safe space and preventing epistemic (heteronormativistic / white privileged) violence in a world in which this flourishes? This night, Manon la Decadence from Adem Inn and Melanin Kris from Artchitex le Visionairs take us on a journey towards more safe inclusive spaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://ladecadencepense.blogspot.nl/" class="external text">Manon la Decadence</a> studied Humanistics but is better know as a genderclown, hosting safer spaces in Rotterdam with their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Gender-Bending-Queer-Party-1507708335923441/" class="external text">GenderBendingQueerParty</a> and Get a Room! at WORM, and talks and support groups at The Hang-Out 010 and <a href="http://www.ademinn.nu" class="external text">Adem Inn</a>.</p>
Melanin Kris produces sound, still and motion pictures that can be read as 21st century imagining of afro-futuristic aesthetics. &quot;We believe all are conscious co-creators of reality and therefore Artchitex of the future. We do not believe in limitations but celebrate results. It's a lifestyle&quot;. &quot;Spoken word is expressive and enables performers to speak openly and honestly about issues in a controlled and safe environment&quot;.

Why are we in pursuit of an inclusive city? How can social art and design contribute to this aspiration? What concrete social art and design practices are we able to realise? With whom and for whom? These questions are central in the Beyond Social Event of February 9th 2017 at Het Nieuwe Instituut.

<p>In 2016, the WdKA department of Social Art and Design initiated with local partners a multi-year programme in three districts of Rotterdam. Our aim is to contribute to the becoming of an inclusive city and to learn how to be effective in doing so. The programme is implemented in the neighbourhood’s Bospolder-Tussendijken / M4H-area (Delfshaven), Afrikaanderwijk (Feijenoord) and Beverwaard (IJsselmonde). In these neighbourhood’s we work with partners such as CultuurConcreet, Bouwkeet, Delfshaven Coöperatie, Bibliotheek Rotterdam, Freehouse/ Wijkcooperatie Afrikaanderwijk, Veldacademie, IJsselwijs and Erasmus MC. These partners address different issues in society related to the DNA of these area’s, experimenting with 'inclusive' next-economy, gentrification and positive health approaches. The name ‘line 23’ refers to the tram line number 23, trans-secting Rotterdam from North-West to South-East, from Marconiplein to Beverwaard, connecting the three districts involved. Line 23 is also known as one of the longest tram lines in the Netherlands. Our Community of Practice identifies with these notions of traversing the city, connecting and opting for the long range.</p>

<p>Our use of the notion 'Inclusive City' is inspired by a recent World Bank Study. Although the study is mainly based on research in metropoles in Latin America and Asia it provides a very useful framework for analyzing the situation in a city such as Rotterdam. Although this model requires some 'translation' to the West-European context it is more suitable than most Urban Development concepts. These are in most cases focused on how to develop the city in stead of the people actually living in it. The World Bank framework is people centred.</p>

<p>This is a project about plantation workers from Congo who made sculptures out of chocolate, directed by Renzo Martens. Those people worked for Unilever many years, before another company took it over. They live at the plantation and the houses were built by Unilever. The houses are almost breaking apart and they still have to pay for the houses even the old people who can't work anymore. To make it even worse they don't get retirement fund. The idea behind the chocolate sculptures is that an artist can make art about poverty, but it would be fair if poor people can make art about their own stories and opinions and can make money form it, instead of a random artist. That is what this hole project is about. Renzo Martens directed the people and he turns the workers into artists. He is in the position to realize this project.</p>
<p>The main reason why this project is so good is because Renzo Martens is actually saying that there is really something wrong within art, that has critics on inequality in the world. In the Tate Modern were critical political exhibitions of artists like Ai Wei Wei. These exhibitions were sponsored by Unilever for a few years. At the end you could say that these exhibitions were sponsored by the plantation workers. This says a lot about the art world. It contributes to the inequality and should reflect on it as an art piece. In the opinion of Renzo Martens this makes an art piece wrong.</p>
<p>The context of this project is social and economic. With mold of the sculptures they get filled with Chocolate in Amsterdam where the biggest cacao fabric is located. People can buy this chocolate sculptures in the gallery Fons Welters. They will earn more money then Unilever ever have given to them. The goal is to sell at least 10.000 of these sculptures so they can live from it. They already raised 18.000 euros. Renzo Martens is planning to start an art center in the plantation. The goal is within 10 years the people in Congo can live there from the sculptures and the art center without his help.</p>
<p>Renzo Martens is creating a critical point on how critical art is being organized. If we make art about poverty of the plantation workers, they wont have the benefit of it. “The people in Congo can think critical about inequality in the world. We don’t have to do that for them. We are doing that because we can write and read but that doesn’t mean that they can’t do it ourselves.”</p>
<p>He is also creating gentrification in the old Unilever plantation by starting an art Centre where art can be fully independent from the world inequality. This project is participating in the world of citizen. Its improving their life’s and gives them an opportunity in a remote area to express themselves about inequality in the world trough the sculptures. They can achieve a big audience. The art center is a system of institution and this hole project is realized by the Institute for Human Activities which is located in Congo. Renzo Martens is still looking for a good structure where one part of the money is going to the Congolese artists and the other part to realize more projects for the community. He is looking for a model to create more profit to expand it in other plantations. This project creates with the sculptures a new images and stories from the Congolese people, new relationships with Renzo Martens and also with the art world.</p>
<p>The problem in this project is that one plantation area in Congo has been chosen to create an art center so that they can life from it. But what about other plantations? This project can be focused in more then just one area. The treat that could arise is that this area is becoming more prosperous than other areas.</p>
<p>Its hard to come up with a solution because this is a very smart strategic project which is reflecting on critical art and at the same time improving life of plantation workers. It would be better if this project reaches other areas and make them prosperous to. By realizing this project on the plantation area with direction of Renzo Martens, he can choose a leader from the area who can extend this idea or can create more ideas to enlarge the capitalism from the plantation area and workers. Renzo Martens can also start museums in different areas where only work from “poor” people will be exhibited.</p>

<p>This is how I feel about my Curaçaoans. </p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
Being a black, queer, femme, woman born in Curaçao, living here in the Netherland, gave me the opportunity to explore the diaspora within Afro-Caribbean/latin belief system within this body. Doing research on Santería in Cuba made me more aware that I can use these rituals and adapt them in combination with traditional rituals from Curaçao that I grew up with, to make sense of reality and to make sense of myself in a new location. This also in a way tells a story of my religious and spiritual life, or how spirituality plays a role in my life.

<div class="article">
<p><strong>Background story</strong> short introduction of my fascination</p>
<p><br />
My fascination with supernatural things and rituals started when I was 15 and my grandma passed away, I tried to connect to her via an ouija board. This was my first attempt at trying to connect to something not tangible, something that we cannot see or touch. At that moment I truly believed that it was possible for me to connect to a different (Paranormal, magical, mystical, supernatural) world/frequency that wasn't the one we were living in. In contrast to this non catholic way to attempt to connect to this other world/ frequency, I have always felt obligated, to go to church (Catholic), and I perceived bible as a big book of myth. Some of the texts written in bible to me seems like fantasy. Since the first year of studying at the Willem de Kooning Academy, I have been doing a lot of research on colonialism as related to Curaçao; specifically what is the stereotypical image of people from the Dutch Antilles in the media here in The Netherlands. While doing this research I came across video’s, books and articles related to the use of Christianity, how it was used during slavery to tame or to create structure/Institutions (to manipulate/indoctrinate the enslaved people a certain way to get a specific result) in a society. And at the same time these former enslaved people were not allowed to practice their own beliefs. This resulted in syncretism (the fusion of diverse religious beliefs and practices) like the afro-Caribbean/ cuban belief, Santería.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Brua in Curaçao</strong></p>
<p>Believing in a magical practice is pretty common on the island of Curaçao, but strangely enough it is still a taboo to talk about it openly (Blom, 2013). The majority of the population identify as Roman Catholic and/ or Christian (Groenewoud, 2013) but most of them beside being Catholic/Christian, also combine a few pagan rituals that are related to and come from a West African belief system, For example, the “Ifá” religion from the Yoruba people from Nigeria. Every Afro-Caribbean (Santería, Candomble, Vodum, 21 Divisiones, etc) practice that is not related to Catholicism or Christianity, is called “Brua” by the Christians/ Catholics in Curaçao. Brua is an umbrella term for everything that can be considered pagan, for example witchcraft, superstitions, charlatanism, divination, etc. It can be used to do good and bad. Basically it has a negative connotation in this society, therefore the specialists do not call themselves hasidó di brua, but trahadó di misterio [mystery workers]. (Allen, 2010) Some of the pagan practices I grew up with were: using “blous” Reckitt’s Crown Blue and/or “man pretu” a black and gold necklace/pendant with the form of a fist, primarily as protection for babies against the evil eye (“oyada”,”Mal de ojo” or “evil eye” is a folk illness primarily affecting children, with infants being particularly vulnerable. This supernatural belief holds that an admiring look or a stare can weaken the child, leading to bad luck, sickness and even death.) However, Reckitt’s Crown Blue is also being used on adults and around the house, as protection against bad energy.</p>
<p><strong>Living and researching Santería in</strong> The Netherlands</p>
<p><br />
Living in The Netherlands for almost 7 years has been really different and disconnected from what makes me feel good and grounded. In the Netherlands I feel as if everything happens behind closed doors, there are so many rules, people are more individualistic, and on the religious area most people that I talk to told me that they don’t believe in anything. My reality shifted. This experience also opened my eyes to see “Bruheria” in a total different way, because I started searching for ways to feel grounded and to feel more at home here. Most of these practices are non-Catholic rituals, like burning incense and candles, doing meditation and trying to connect to myself. Living and going to school here and exploring my identity and spirituality, I notice that in the history of my island, religion plays a big role in forming how people live there. The conversion of Arawak Indians (natives from Curaçao) to Catholicism, the transportation of the enslaved people from Africa with their own religion/belief and the imposition of christianity in the form of Catholicism on them (Lampe, 2001) was the reason why Curaçao is so strongly a Catholic Island with a hint of hidden “bruheria” practices that everyone knows about, but won’t talk about openly. We were taught from a young age that “brua” is something diabolical and or warned that you have to be careful with it if you get involved with it. However, I feel like this is the same technique the colonizers used but by incorporating the bible and the word of god to manipulate/tricked our ancestors into believing that the religion that what they were doing and practicing is actually diabolical, and inferior compared to Catholicism. Catholicism was a superior version of a religion for the poor/enslaved peoples but Protestantism was the most superior religion (Lampe, 2001). Catherine Bell’s (2009) ritual theory explains how colonizers (Dutches) have used their power as a tool for change and domination, that can also be considered as ritual. She describes ritualization: “At a basic level, ritualization is the production of this differentiation. At a more complex level, ritualization is a way of acting that specifically establishes a privileged contrast, differentiating itself as more important or powerful.” This definition, could be directly connected to religious rituals, in her book she also mentions: “Ritualization is the way to construct power relation when the power is claimed to be from God, not from military might or economic superiority; it is also the way for people to experience a vision of a community order that is personally empowering”(Bell, 2009). The video “Savonet Museum Films_Santería” was the first video that introduce me to the afro-Caribbean/latin religion of Santería on the island of Curaçao. Santería became something so fascinating to me that I started doing research on the relation between this and Christianity/Catholicism and the connection between the Catholic saint’s and the Orishas. It appeared to be the main religion in Cuba, so my research took me there and I decided to go to Cuba to study this personally.</p>
<p><strong>Field research in Cuba, Feb 2017</strong></p>
<p><br />
The research methods I used in Cuba were a mix of observing, walking round the city, talking informally to people about the culture and specifically the syncretism named Santería, and participating in local ceremonies. Attending a few ceremony there I realized that Santería is a way of living and it’s part of the every day culture in Cuba. Everyone there knows about it, and everyone is involved in it one way or another. Just walking in the streets of Havana, I have seen a lot of offerings to specific Orisha, and there were a lot of people wearing “eleke” colorful bracelets or necklaces, at that time I didn't know the significance of all the color. Santería plays a big role in cuban politics. Politicians have consultations with santera/os to win battles against their rivals. For example: people interpreted something that happened during a speech Fidel Castro gave (Havana, cuba 8 January 1959) when a white dove landed on his shoulder, as a presence of the Orisha Obatala (the Orisha that created the world and humanity, the guide of every saints, syncretised as “Virgen de las Mercedes”).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Ceremonies</strong></p>
<p><br />
At these different ceremonies that I visited, I always felt like I was part of it even though I didn't know any one. The ceremony was always accompanied by music and altars, and people were always dancing. At these moments I felt like I connected to something, but don't know how, I felt the need to move, dance, and so I did. The drum music lead the whole ceremony and the dancing of the person that get moved/mounted (I will use the word mounted, because it’s the best way to translate the Spanish word ”montar” which is when a spirit takes over a persons body) by the spirit of ancestors. And the altar ( if looking at it from the perspective of someone that doesn't know anything of this belief it) looks like the decoration for a party/ ceremony. Many rituals I saw were repeated in all these ceremonies, and objects that were used for one ritual were also used for another ritual. There were also rituals with animal sacrifices and/or with food offerings. Rituals to cleanse yourself before entering a ceremony and divination rituals, some of them were very private that I was not allowed to be present in the room, because i was not a santera.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Walking around the city</strong></p>
<p><br />
To be more specific, Santería is mixture of European Christianity, Spanish Catholicism, African Orisha worship from the Yoruba belief and French originated Kardecan spiritualism (de La Torre,2001). All of these practices come with a number of rituals that are being practiced during ceremonies and in everyday life. It was easy to spot or recognise some of these rituals, because they were actions that you see happening constantly, by the same groups of people. You also notice these people because they had specific dress code (initiators dress all in white for a year, all santeros had elekes), that symbolise a their connection to the Yoruba tradition in Cuba. Other ceremonies I visited used different kind of symbolic objects. These symbolic objects are simply everyday objects with a special arrangement or a special version. E.g. a table with seven glasses of water is something we can see in our daily life, but when you see these glasses on a table (La Boveda Espiritual: 7 glasses filled with water in a specific arrangement, the glass in the centre contain a metal crucifix, during a spiritism ceremony, you know that it has a totally different meaning, and that there is a specific way to act around this object. Another object that I have seen a lot was clay jars (tinaja) and soup bowls both with lids, these were filled with rocks (and other secretive substance) that were carefully picked by performing a ritualistic divining process with coconut shells or cowry shells. This process is the only way to know which rock is destined for this purpose. This filled jar/bowl represent the Orishas. When the normal purpose of such an object is everyday, their symbolic use is marked by prescribed, formalized action, so that the movements and gesture involved also become symbolic (Bull, Mitchell, 2016). Other objects and products that were frequently used in rituals during/on various other ceremonies/ altars were: Cascarilla (solidified eggshell powder mix), coconut, seashells, palm oil, statue of the orisha Eleguá (the deity of the crossroads, he is also know as Saint Michael, Saint Anthony of Padua, or the Holy Child of Atocha in Catholicism) drums, herbs, flowers, metal crucifix, cigars, herbs, añil (indigo), rum/ aguardiente etc. Most of these objects and products were made out of natural material. I was told that everything natural obtains “Ashé”, Ashé is the power/energy to make things happen and make changes, it is also used similarly to the word amen/blessing.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Informal conversation</strong></p>
<p>During a few informal conversation I had with a few santera/os I was told of some rituals that needed to be practiced everyday, like taking off your eleke’s: at night before going to sleep, during showers, and sexual activities. Saluting your Orisha in the morning is also a really significant ritual to do, because this will help you start your day on a good note, and it is also a way to show respect to your guardian angel/Orisha. Another ritual I observed being carried out/done daily by this santero (he had the Orisha Eleguá crowned) before leaving his house, was doing a circular motion around his head with a machete, as a way to salute his Orisha Eleguá. People in Cuba and elsewhere believe rituals are a way to put our energy in tune with the energy that are in forces of/in nature (Teish, 2012). By doing these rituals every day you will feel spiritually more grounded, and more connected to nature on a personal level because Orisha’s are the personification of nature’s forces.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Ritual &amp; resistance</strong></p>
<p><br />
After my visit to Cuba I noticed a lot of similarities between Santería, and what we called Brua in Curaçao even though Santería would also be considered Brua. I was wondering even though Curaçao and Cuba have a colonial past where Christianity was imposed on the enslaved people, why is it that the majority of the society of Curaçao is Catholic, but in Cuba the majority is involved in many kinds of Afro-Cuban religion? The reason why the majority of people on Curaçao claim that they are Catholic, is because (Im going to use the theory of third space by Homi Bhabha) the African religions that the Enslaved people brought to Curaçao/ Cuba which is the first space, was not allowed to be practiced, so the European imposes Christianity/Catholicism ( second space) upon the Africans, this resulted into Santería and/or what we as Curaçaoans called Catholicism which is the third space, but I think this religion should be called Afro-Catholicism. In my opinion the Afro-Catholicism from Curaçao is more based on what is written in the bible, it is less related to spirituality, but more to how you should behave as a respectable/decent person.The Catholicism that is practiced in Curaçao was never a mere copy of African traditions nor of European culture (Lampe, 2001), This is the reason why I think that Curaçaoans call themselves Catholic, it was a way to hide their practice from the oppressor. This adapted version of Catholicism was a form of resistance against the system in Curaçao, and in Cuba Santería was a form of resistance (de La Torre,2001). Santería is more embedded in the culture and if you want to be part of it, that’s your choice, and the most important thing to me is that it is more involved with the spirituality of a human being and how to make people feel good from the inside, and it is always executed with a group of people, and most are originated from our ancestors that came from the continent of Africa. A different form of resistance that was used in Curaçao during the colonial period was: -“Tambú”. The word tambú referred to the instrument, which is a drum, the music, and the dance. It is a traditional African custom. Even thought tambú was prohibited during slavery, and was condemned by the Catholic church, it’s still a ritual we practice, especially during the end of the year (Allen, 2007). -Using the storytelling of “Nanzi”, the trickster spider the main character in these stories represent the enslaved people and the other character Shon (Shon, papiamentu word for slave master) Arei, referred to the slave master, this enabled the master-slave relationship to be shown and talked about within these stories. They were also a reflection of the enslaved people on the Catholic and African religious traditions, these stories spoke out against the slaves’ situation (Lampe, 2001). -People also used Catholic saints as a cover for the Orishas. This was not only happening in Curaçao, but mainly practiced in Santería in Cuba. Santería is basically a religion or resistance as these people were not allowed to practice their own beliefs/religion, and therefore they start using Catholic saints as a cover for their practice of African religious rituals and adoration of the Orishas. For example Yemaya is syncretized as “La virgen de la Regla”, Eleguá as “San Antonio”, Oshun as “La Virgen de La Caridad del Cobre”, etc. The rituals of Santería were a critique of the dominant power structure. For example, a white decapitated dove found on the front step of the “Christian” slaveholder serve as a sign of forthcoming disaster (de La Torre,2001).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>A spiritism ceremony</strong></p>
<p><br />
The spiritism ceremony was the ceremony where I had the most intense experience regarding spirits taking over human bodies, because I have seen people get mounted by Orishas and Egguns (ancestor spirit), these people start acting exactly like the entity that has possessed them. The drum player is the one that leads the whole process. Tambú (drum) party in Curaçao is similar to the spiritism ceremony in Cuba, involving a group of people that collectively organised and/or participate at these event, except from the part where spirits mounted the people, this only happens in the spiritism ceremonies, and not in tambú. Now they become a tradition that bring people together and/or form a community where you get a sense of belonging. The spiritism ceremony in Cuba involves a variety of rituals, the drum that were played was a way to call the spirits, when a spirit appear, someone will get mounted, the mounted person will react to the rhythm of the drum, the drummer will be the one that know if this person is faking a spirit possession or not, because he is the one who guide the ceremony at the moment. All of these rituals they were doing was a way to give something back to the participant and also a way to heal and help the person that has organized this ceremony. Dancing on the beat of the drum, as they told me, is also a ritual that helps dispose of all negative energy, and you will dance for the Orishas so that they can bless you. All of this is related to and comes from the past where our ancestors were using these kind of ceremony to release the stress of working on the plantation the whole day, because they were going through a lot, it was a sort of escapism. “If you perform an action repetitively with a desire result thats basically a ritual (Teish, 2012).” This is how Lusiah Teish describe the word ritual, she also observes that rituals are practised in a sacred space. This is also a way to connect to the nature and your spiritual self. Rituals are things that you do as a routine, it involves the factor of time, and you do then in a specific space at a specific moment. I have already mentioned the Tambú party, this party just like the spiritism ceremony in Cuba, involves dancing to release bad energy, but now it became a tradition to organise at the end of the year, so you can dance on the beat of the drums “i kore ku fuku”( get rid of bad spirit).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Need to create ritual and how I apply them in an anti-ritual space</strong></p>
<p><br />
My urge to create rituals came primarily from a place of anger. Because I have noticed that Curaçao Catholicism/Chritianity permeated every aspect of (free/enslaved) peoples life, e.g. their education, marriage, etc, and while talking to Curaçaoan living on the island, that a lot of them build their argument around bible verses especially when it comes to the subject of homosexuality. And to me this is the result of the education in schools that is also attached to Catholicism and our colonial past. This is the reason why I think that if we don't do research for ourselves we will never get to know our own history. School are the perfect institution to introduce these kind of subjects. Instead of focusing on the history of The Netherlands, start teaching about our own country and culture and also the idea that brua or any other pagan beliefs are not diabolic, primitive and/or ugly. People from Curaçao are Catholic or Christian and most are not interested in talking about religion (I know that because I was one of them). So I would like to inform them in a way and/or change their perspective on why and how Catholicism/christianity was brought to Curaçao. During LGBTQI pride in 2016, there were a lot of people and politicians criticising the movement/celebration and also a few flags that were placed on our really well known pontoon bridge (the Emma brug). The arguments that they were using to criticise this event, were purely based on bible passages, whilst the politician Marilyn Moses said that Pride is not part of our culture. Religion was most of the time argument against everything that is considered immoral according to the bible. Everything else was considered barbaric, or diabolic. And this is the why I connect christianity to the physical world, and beliefs like the Santería to spirituality. Being born a certain gender doesn't have anything to do with who I like/ love, is only biological/physical. But the bible said that god create man and woman. While in the stories of the Orishas, you can see that in one story the Orisha/deity Obatala is represented as a male figure, and in another story they is a female. These two examples show that Christianity was built around the human, as physical bodies.A few text in the bible that refers to homosexuality as a sin and that heteronormativity is the norm are: Leviticus 20:13 - If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. Matthew Chapter:19: verse:4-6 : 4 “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ 5 and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” My need to create rituals and altar also came from my curiosity of playing with aspects of culture and religion while in a different space. Even though it is difficult to experience and comprehend rituals from another culture that is not yours, because you can misinterpret them, I did my best while I was in Cuba to get closer to the experience by observing and acting like they do, so there would be less friction between the space between me and them. That way I could understand more about what they were doing and what they were experiencing while e.g. dancing on the beat of the drum, or cleansing before entering a sacred space of ceremony. Trying to recreate these experience in a place where these thing are not common, was difficult for me to execute, due of the weather, and there are a lot of rules that you need to keep in mind before doing these kind of things. But doing my performance, installation “It’s Like a Sickness”, added something more natural/organic and colourful to the industrial landscape of Rotterdam.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>My practice</strong></p>
<p><br />
The seri ‘Kuaresma’ (Lent) is the last project I was working on. The word kuaresma derived from the latin word “Quadragesima” which means fortieth (cuarenta in Spanish). The fortieth, refers to several biblical verses, one of them symbolised the test which Jesus passed by staying in the desert for 40 days. In lent it is a tradition for Catholic’s to abstain and fast, I decided to challenge myself in the form of penitence by making a work a day. I created work that shows my dislike for the Catholic religion I grew up with, Mixed with elements of Santería which became my area of interest and fascination. You can say that these works were a challenge to the critique Catholicism is always giving Santería, or any other pagan practices. It also shows the way I deal with both practices in my work and in daily life. As it is difficult to let go of, as it (Catholic traditions) was part of my upbringing, and the other was there but not as vivid or acceptable. Not eating meat on Fridays during lent was one of the traditional rituals I grew up with, this is basically a Catholic ritual, but on the other hand, in this same period there were execution of superstitious/pagan rituals, for example if you get home after 00:00, you have to enter the house with your back, otherwise bad spirit/ energy will enter behind you. This was a way for me to spend the period of lent in my way, and at the same time I feel like this was the first time I did commit to something during this period, normally it’s just like an obligation, and I don't feel comfortable to do it. But by combining art and a tradition I grow up with it made it easier for me to achieve this. Even though there were a few days when I didn't want to do anything, I still did the sacrifice of making something simple for that day. You can compare this challenge I did with the people that fast/abstain, pray and/or do charity during lent. I felt weak, frustrated, tired and even uninspired or without motivation to go on with what I was doing. And I did this for 40 consecutive days. Working like this gave me the opportunity to work with my frustration and to work against the period of lent with rituals that are not part of its tradition. I was able to explore my options in the form of art, and making rituals that takes my mind off the reality around me, and play around with my ideal form of spirituality, by combining the tradition I grew up with and Santería. In this seri I've used a lot of red and blue, the color red (and black) represent the Orisha Eleguá which is the keeper of the crossroad between the real world and the spirit/magical world. And he is identified with the number 3, which is also the reason why most of my works are divided in 3 cause it represent the crossover/transition between the subject that plays a role in my works. Some time instead of using the color red, I will use catholic saints like Saint Anthony, or holy infant of Atocha, these are the variation of Eleguá in Catholicism. The blue stand for the blue product (blous) that we use a lot in Curaçao for protection against evil eye. Blue also stands for my favourite Orisha Yemaya, which is the mother of all, the mother of the sea, she rules all the seven seas, so she is identified with the nr 7. In the works I have also used silver and the Catholic saint that represent Yemaya, which is Our Lady of the Rule. To me these Orishas are the two most important ones, because of their purpose. The objects I’ve added to my works are also being used in Santería rituals, but the statues of saints that I use are ways to represent the Orishas in a western way, because there are no specific human figure that represent the forces of nature. The only way you can get an image of these Orishas, is only if you use your imagination, because the patakís (story concerning the origins and interrelationships of the Orishas, as well as the role they play in determining the destiny of humanity (de La Torre,2001) of Orishas were only orally narrated. I have also made collages that documented experiences I had at different religious ceremonies in combination with landscape and products. An example is the work “Mi Eggun, Mi congo/a” which was something a mounted woman told me about the image of my Eggun and how to treat him/her, and I made a portrait of this. Language is also something I use some times in my work, e.g. they have told me that I have “Un negro congo” as my Eggun, “negro” is translated means Black, so I started using the black hand pendant as the hand of the ancestor in most of my work.</p>

An increasing number of designers see the formulation of a business model as a design challenge in itself. As a result of the financial crisis and ongoing social transitions, old certainties have become fluid and new business models are emerging: business models in which the basis of multiple value creation is provided by new and existing cash flows, local entrepreneurship, social capital, open networks, energy transition and new technologies. An increasing number of designers and artists play an important role in the development of these new business models.

<p>A new design practice is emerging, one which no longer focuses solely on designing a beautiful table, a good building or a pleasant neighbourhood, but also considers the processes in which these designs were realised as a design challenge in itself. An increasing number of designers share their designs according to open source principles, and allow consumers to influence the creation process by participating in its development, financing or fabrication. For example, initiatives such as Space&amp;matter's 'CRWDBLDNG', 'Blauwhoed' and 'Open Development', and the project 'Wikihouse' by strategy office 00://. We are increasingly witnessing the emergence of new forms of ownership; local initiatives are claiming vacant buildings, people can lease jeans instead of buying them, and small groups of individuals are setting up neighbourhood energy cooperatives. Additionally, the circular economy is increasingly perceived as a way out of the current ecological and economic crises. For example, projects such as Superuse Studios' 'Villa Welpeloo', Duzan Doepel's 'Biobased Retrofit House', and 'De Ceuvel' by Metabolic Lab and Space&amp;matter. In such projects, local issues (waste products, energy, local communities and expertise) become valuable assets. In all these projects, the designers have not only designed the physical final object, but also contributed to designing the relevant business model, which in turn plays a role in defining the physical manifestation of the design. In other words, this type of participation in the design of the context opens up new possibilities for the physical design.</p>

<h4 id="social-practices"><span id="Social_Practices" class="mw-headline">Social Practices</span></h4>
<p>Designers whose work practice is based on this type of perspective regarding the scope of their professional field, are active in what can be considered as 'social practices'. Social practices are gaining in popularity these days, with an increasing number of projects, publications and conferences on the subject. For example, two books presented recently at the Dutch Design Week 2014: 'Social Design for Wicked Problems' and 'Looks Good, Feels Good, Is Good', as well as conferences such as 'What Design Can Do' and 'Rethink'. This development seems to pick up on work done ten years ago by artists such as Jeanne van Heeswijk and Sabrina Lindemann, for example the project 'De Strip' in Vlaardingen and 'OpTrek Transvaal' in The Hague.</p>
<p>The resurgence of social practices in the contemporary discourse of art, design and education should come as no surprise: it is a reaction to a society in a state of transition. Though our society has always been changing, currently these changes seem to be taking place faster, more intensively and more broadly than what we had previously been accustomed to. Many believe that the future will not be merely an extrapolation of the present and the familiar, but that there are systemic shifts taking place simultaneously on several levels, in various disciplines and on different scales. Whether this change of system turns out to be relatively large or small, an important characteristic of social practitioners is that they explicitly choose to research and critically examine such change, and to play a role in its design. Competent social designers and social artists can position themselves in an original way as game changers. It is not surprising that many designers are currently active in this field. On one hand, the time seems ripe to work on the development of alternative business models; the old ways of doing business no longer work or have proven undesirable. On the other hand, tools from the creative disciplines - such as design thinking and systemic analysis - help make it possible to design new business models.</p>
<h4 id="change-of-system"><span id="Change_of_system" class="mw-headline">Change of system</span></h4>
<p>Though some believe that once we have made it through the current economic crisis, we will go back to the way things were before, others argue that the world of tomorrow will be very different from that of yesterday. The Russian Economist Nikolai Kondratiev has convincingly argued that crises are always preceded by social revolutions, for example the industrial revolution or the introduction of the automobile. What all these crises have in common is that the world before and after the crisis is completely different; with different organisational structures, new business models, and new players in charge. If we consider the current crisis a similar tipping point, this can become an opportunity for re-thinking the creative disciplines as well as existing business models.</p>
<p>During the past century, citizens had gradually become dependent on an economic structure which was increasingly uniform and large-scale, and regulated according to top-down models. New generations, on the other hand, seem to increasingly make use of more horizontal structures, while operating through various (invisible) networks and expressing their social and political engagement through quick and flexible structures. At the same time, we can also observe a movement in the opposite direction: ever-increasing consumption, individualisation, increase of scale, and clustering of power in the hands of a smaller number of larger multinationals; as well as exhaustion of natural resources, peak oil, plastic soup, the exploitation of people, animals and the planet, and ever-increasing income inequality. Another important factor is large-scale migration streams, with the associated refugee dramas and xenophobia. Furthermore, we are faced with new challenges in the fields of ageing demographics, social care and healthcare, economic and demographic shrinkage, and food and water shortages.</p>
<p>Sailing on the choppy waves of such complex developments, various thinkers and designers are proposing a change of system; a switch from large-scale to small-scale structures, from large initial investments to more gradual cash flow plannings, from organisations with a few professionals in charge to practices with a large number of players, from final situation to initial situation, from trust in standard methods to experimentation with new ones, from financial gain to multiple value creation.</p>

<h4 id="redesigning-business"><span id="Redesigning_Business" class="mw-headline">Redesigning Business</span></h4>
<p>Mapping, shifting the perspective, reframing and the ability to bring various stakeholders together are all skills which are especially relevant in the context of a change of system. Social practices can play a valuable role here. Two constantly recurring aspects in social practices are: the introduction of the time factor in the development process, and the focus on the existing situation – the people, networks, buildings, knowledge, expertise, materials and needs that are already present. In social practices, designers connect these local forces in such a way that allows for new perspectives, which are given the time to develop step by step, so that new visions on ownership and capital can emerge.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not always a simple process. A change of system always requires a great deal of patience, daring and perseverance, as well as improvisational ability, systems analysis and change management. As a consequence, the field of art and design education is also changing. Since 2011, the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague offers the new master programme 'INSIDE'; the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam offers 'Social Practices' as one of its three new interdisciplinary graduation profiles; and the Design Academy in Eindhoven offers the master programme 'Social Design'. In other countries, this change is also acknowledged, for example in Baltimore (Center for Social Design) and at Budapest's Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design(EcoLab). All these programmes are based on the idea that interdisciplinarity is now a reality, and change management has become a necessity in order to supersede existing practices.</p>

<p>There is no blueprint for how to proceed and that is a good thing too. However, a specific attitude can clearly be observed: an attitude which links ideals to decisiveness and imagination, with and in the here and now, and without becoming preachy or patronising. This is the attitude that will bring welcome change to part of the world of art and design.</p>

The RDM (Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij) is a former shipbuilding wharf located in a remote area in the harbour of Rotterdam. Due to the isolated location, the company built the village of Heijplaat in 1914 to provide housing for its employees. Since the 1990s however the area has undergone a series of important transformations, many of which have had a negative impact on the local population. My project 'Samenspel' focused on this specific location, and also on the question: how to reshape the connection between the RDM wharf and the village? Can I design (the implementation of) a new function for the RDM that attracts the local population?

<p>When the RDM wharf went through a serious crisis during the 1990s, many people from Heijplaat lost their jobs. The village has been in a state of transition ever since; it doesn't seem to be functioning as it was originally meant to. Many recreational activities and former functional spots in the area have shut down, and there has been a gradual increase the number of empty houses. Though the harbour area is connected to the city by a ferry service, it remains difficult to reach and it is seen by outsiders as too far from the city centre. The recently developed RDM Campus and Submarine Wharf provide facilities and host projects for applied research, innovation and experimentation, which attract visitors and users from outside the village of Heijplaat. These social, cultural, educational and business activities in the RDM area are no longer addressed to the residents of Heijplaat, resulting in a malfunction in the social structure and the connection between the inhabitants and their surroundings.</p>
<h3 id="teamwork"><span id="Teamwork" class="mw-headline">Teamwork</span></h3>
<p>The port of Rotterdam and the village of Heijplaat have embarked upon a three-year restructuring process starting in 2014, the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Heijplaat. The village is inhabited by a community which revolves around clubs and associations. I joined a residents' initiative whose goal was to establish a Jeu de Boules (Pétanque) club. I planned to set up and design the club's identity. On June 15, 2014, my activities and my collaboration with the club, which were meant to go on for two years, resulted in the first Heijplaat Jeu de Boules Tournament on pier 2602, at 'the entrance side' of the RDM area. The Pier was recently reopened after renovation but lacked a specific function and was thus underused. Therefore I decided to claim this piece of public space in order to reuse it, as a meaningful and exciting temporary event location. On that day we played Jeu de Boules with a mix of local residents from Heijplaat and visitors from other parts of Rotterdam. The 'image' of that day was defined by the location itself as well as the participating teams. I curated and visually designed these elements with the participation of many businesses within the RDM area. The community of Heijplaat residents reconquered on that day the RDM area, and the RDM companies intensified their contact with the local residents.</p>

an exploration on ways to find meaning and explore consciousness by creating a more inclusive media archive
</div>
<div class="summary">
This paper investigates the reason and consequences of lack of diversity in storytelling and suggests ways to fix it by focusing on animation as the most effective storytelling medium.
<p>The lack of diversity in the most powerful and inspiring medium of the humans bears destructive consequences. Countries that have no strong media presence are under the mercy of how dominant media displays them. Valuable cultures, traditions, rituals that have been developed in ancient societies that serves as inspiration and to assist people in defining their purpose is being othered and marginalized by what dominant media defines and displays them as.</p>
The more your presence becomes othered and marginalized the less you believe in the validity of your perspective in seeing the world. This causes a systematic lack of self-esteem where your possibility of reaching self-actualization becomes less possible. You get less control over your behavior and reaction which creates behavioral errors and makes you even more vulnerable to exclusion. I research the human consciousness through neuropsychology and culture to understand the narrow and biased information we uphold about the world and our own capacities to stress the importance of producing a more inclusive media archive that challenges our structure of thoughts.

<h4 id="introduction"><span id="Introduction" class="mw-headline">Introduction</span></h4>
<p>My parents were surprised when I continued watching animated films and series after reaching an age where they would expect me to develop other interests. I enjoyed watching animation to an extent where my first love is even a fictional character. When I was a child, the animations on screen were subtitled, but I couldn’t read yet. So, along with Turkish at home and Dutch at school I had learned English from watching animation. My parents took pride in having a child who mumbled three different languages. My family moved around a lot and I was a very shy child, my tool to make friends in new schools was by drawing cartoon characters for my classmates to impress them. It wasn’t until I went to high school that I landed in an environment where my classmates wouldn’t be interested in cartoon characters anymore, so I left that as a tool to bond and just became an ordinary teenager. The first three years of high school was very dissatisfying for me until I got a classmate that introduced me to a new wave of Japanese animations online that were available to be seen with English subtitles. I went home to watch the first episode of Death Note (Tetsuro Araki, 2006-7) on YouTube and it was the first time for me to see an animation with such elevated aesthetics and visuals, it was unlike anything that I had ever seen before. I couldn’t believe my eyes, it was visually so incredible, and the story was unlike anything I had ever watched that it compensated the way Japanese sounded to me, a language which I had never heard. I couldn’t distinguish a sound from one another but by the end of the series I could sing along to the intro music, differentiate words from each other and developed an interest to the culture, I wanted more. The story was about An intelligent high school student goes on a secret crusade to eliminate criminals from the world after discovering a notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is written into it. (imdb) The discoveries that followed Death Note has led me to go back to drawing, it wasn’t only the fascination towards the aesthetics of the animations that I watched, but also the narratives that were different from what I consumed on Dutch TV which were dominantly American. The idea of a young person in power of adjusting the justice system like in Death Note just opened up doors of questions and possibilities.</p>
<p>The older I got, the more I understood how complicated the world around me was and how language plays a big role in that. Having a diverse cultural background, I was an outsider everywhere I went to. I was Turkish in the Netherlands and European in Turkey. Growing up with multiple languages has also earned me praise but made me half a person in every language I spoke. This created situations where I would feel extremely uncomfortable to speak up because I would not have the self esteem to represent myself well. This became especially more of a problem when tension towards people with a migrant background or Muslim belief would elevate with the ongoing and amplifying political conflicts related to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Consuming stories from the Japanese narrative had shaped me significantly, it was the story structures from Japanese productions that gave me a better understanding of how I could become more of a person that I would be more comfortable being. The heroines of the animations I watched were not people for whom the universe would adjust according to their desires, the stories were always about a mutual give and take which I discovered to be a common story structure in Japanese animation. I received the guidance in life from animation that I lacked at my home and in school. The realization that animation is such a powerful tool in influencing people’s behavior has brought me to this point today where I stand in a position of pursuing a career in making animated films myself. Listening to people’s stories and being able to create empathy is what provokes curiosity, <em>it is when we can establish bonds of mutual understanding that we can step up to build self-esteem and reach our individual potentials (Maslow, 1987, p. 64).</em></p>

<p>As someone who has also benefitted a lot from Middle Eastern philosophy and Islamic culture I can’t identify myself with the way my heritage and belief are represented and branded on dominant media and how this evolves into violent behavior towards these people in daily life. I’m a living breathing proof for myself that the representation is unjust, so it became my drive to investigate how representation vs. discrimination works.</p>
<p>Scientific racism is something that ‘justifies’ the psyche of the oppressor and the bystanders, when we realize that differences are social and not biological we share responsibilities in understanding each other without disregarding one another. to stress on the importance of telling stories of diverse backgrounds and disciplines and to break down the layers of artificial structures to oppress one another I’d like the explain the importance of the stories that has been kept on hold.</p>
<p>I will explain the way human conscious and subconscious works as a mechanism by investigating reality through the perspective of neuropsychology and how culture influences our perception of ourselves and the world around us. This way I’d like to convince the importance of the effect of diversity in storytelling and why animation is one of the most effective tools in that.</p>

<h3 id="self.i"><span id="SELF.I" class="mw-headline">SELF.I</span></h3>
<p>The experience of the self is divided in neuroscience and psychology in the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Bodily self</strong>: The owning and being of a body in which you are in sync with the physiological needs of the body as a self-sustaining organism. (i.e. feeling hungry, feeling sleepy, feeling energetic etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Perspectival self</strong>: experiencing the world from a first-person view. (i.e. in front of me, behind me etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Volitional self</strong>: The intention of agency and wants, needs, urges and desires. (i.e. I want to be, I don’t want to be etc.)</p>
<p>In higher levels we have:</p>
<p><strong>Narrative self</strong>: The narrative self is where the ‘I’ starts because you become a distinctive person over time, it’s the story of ourselves built from memories associated with bodily, perspectival and volitional experiences. (i.e. My name is xx and I am born and raised in xx I am xx years old and am friends with xx my hobbies are xx etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Social self</strong>: the self through the perception of others and how I am experienced through other minds and thoughts. (i.e. am I popular? Am I loved? Am I criticized? Etc.) (Anil Seth, 2016)</p>
<p>Despite the clear distinctive categories that explain an aspect of self we don’t go through life by living theme separately, we experience all of our aspects of selves as a whole and it is the balance between those aspects that create a healthy and maybe even happy human being. The measurement of the balance of these aspects of the selves are highly subjective and personal however external circumstances which is a reality to all are elements that play a crucial role in the perception of a human being and their sense of self.</p>
<h3 id="self.ii"><span id="SELF.II" class="mw-headline">SELF.II</span></h3>
<p>All sciences are in effort to understand the world in which we live in and to make it more comprehensible. Throughout the centuries we have developed a wide range of methodologies that examine the world from specific perspectives. How we give meaning (perception) to the information we receive (senses) is depending on several elements because we have a number of layers of experienced selves.</p>
<p>Neuroscientist Anil Seth (Ted, 2017) explains in his talk that our own consciousness is all we have that differentiates us of being objects, it is through our consciousness that we experience the world and a sense of self. Throughout our sense of self, we experience feelings of joy and suffering. There are many discussions and questions about the self, some philosophers even argue that the self does not exist (Thomas Metzinger, 2003). Without the self and all its experiences there is no use in any of the efforts in meaning making, in case of my profession as a storyteller I find this too reductant and therefor will focus on a more qualitative approach towards this subject. Anil Seth explains that there are two forms of consciousness. One is the world around us with its multi layered experiences and the other is the specific experience of being who you are, the self. Our brains are triggered by sensory information (taste, sight, smell, hearing and touch) through which our consciousness works. It is in constant effort of trying to grasp of what is out there in the world based on prior expectations and beliefs. Sensation is useful and essential for survival, we can protect ourselves from being hurt by removing ourselves from danger which we depict through our senses. It is also the process of detecting existence of the world around us. (John Krantz, 2013, p.1.6). We are highly dependent on our sensory experiences to make sense of the things around us by depending on the languages of communication and our instincts in detecting safe/unsafe. Yet we confuse the important distinction between sensation and perception. Sense is quite objective, it is perception that is subjective, because, if seeing is believing is everything we see and hear the truth?</p>
<h4 id="the-shape-in-which-we-think"><span id="The_shape_in_which_we_think" class="mw-headline">The shape in which we think</span></h4>
<p>Sensation and perception are interwoven to each other, just like our senses of self. We always experience the world through our sense of self and therefor find it normal that we experience the things the way they are. Our faith in our senses delay us from the fundamental questions such as why we experience things the way we do. Thomas Metzinger does explain an insightful perspective about the self being an ongoing property where we have a sense of ownership over our inner selves in relationship to the outside world and that our sense of selves are very context sensitive and fluid and thus can be manipulated.</p>
<p>Our unquestioned faith in our senses and the fine line between what is sense and what is perceptive is also the reason for arrogance, we experience the world always through our sense of self and thus will always assume that we are the center of the universe unless critically challenged to think otherwise. Just like David Foster Wallace cites in his commencement speech</p>
<p><em>“: The most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.. .. blind certainty – a close mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up”</em></p>
<p>According to Anil Seth, we are all hallucinating all the time and perception is a controlled hallucination where the brain’s predictions about the meaning concerning the received sensory experiences is what we consider ‘reality’, in fact, reality is us agreeing on what we see. The act of speech is for example the act of transmitting thought by sounds which we make with our mouths by hissing and puffing, those actions create air vibrations in the air. Those air vibrations hit the eardrums of the receiver. What follows is the brain taking those vibration from the eardrums and translating them to thoughts (Lera Boroditsky, 2017). So even though quantitative research allows us to understand the ways in which we interact and communicate it is still qualitative research that explores the meaning and significance of a situation. Qualitative research concerns itself with all things in motion, never set and always changing depending on the participants and ongoing change in circumstances.</p>
<p>Senses are self-evident, the act of absorbing and imitating the communicative skills to survive is also something which is self-evident because we need to be able to communicate our needs. Conscious experience is an integrated reality (Thomas Metzinger, 2013) meanings regulate our volitional and narrative selves and these set the rules and norms in which our social life is ordered and governed in. Meaning in which we construct reality out of is always partially understood (Stuart Hall, Representation,p.4) Having a brain and having a nervous system from which your brain senses the world is self-evident but the meaning and perception you give to all of these senses are absolutely not hardwired in us like our height, skin color or family members. The meaning we give to the sensorial experience is entirely dependent on our belief template and narrative self-experiences which consist out of social values such as financial status, climate experience, the culture or society group we belong to. We do automatically absorb the language of the culture we are born into, but we do that to be able to function. The history of a language depends on years of evolution that contributed to that tool of meaning making which again differentiates from area to area. So, the exact same thing in the world can mean absolutely two different things to different individuals. In the past Europe would be governed by the narrative of the Christian religion, Sundays in church were the portion of narrative that guided people through life. Maybe that was even their only portion of a narrative and was the sustaining of life something that took enough time to occupy the mind and prevent it from asking questions about systems and why god was a man for example. But the industrial revelation and the automation of so many things have changed everything. Today, as soon as we are awake we begin to consume stories. Population has grown, nearly all of us own social media where we ‘construct’ our identities, we get breaking news on daily basis. I am primarily fascinated by witnessing my nieces watching animation on tablets and phones. Today we have more utilities and access to material that investigates what it means to be a human being today but maybe we have so much of it that our brains just got immune to those senses.</p>
<h4 id="culture---how-you-see-is-what-you-get"><span id="Culture_-_How_you_see_is_what_you_get" class="mw-headline">Culture - How you see is what you get</span></h4>
<p><em>“Culture internally is concerned with the production and exchange of meanings which we can access through language. So, language serves as a representational system.&quot;</em> - Stuart Hall, 1997</p>
<p>Sciences have developed methods to guarantee outcome in quantitative methods. These experiments have helped humanity in understanding the way our bodies work or our planet and universe. The most reliable source towards meaning making or the experience of the self is culture.</p>
<p><em>“Culture is used to refer to whatever is distinctive about the ‘way of life’ of a people, community, nation or social group’. Culture is concerned with the production and exchange of meanings ‘the giving and taking’ of meaning between the members of a society or group. To say that two people belong to the same culture is to say that they interpret the world in roughly the same ways and can express themselves, their thoughts and feelings about the world, in ways which will be understood by each other. Thus, culture depends on its participants interpreting meaningfully what is happening around them, and ‘making sense’ of the world in broadly similar ways.”</em> - Stuart Hall, Representation, p.2</p>
<p>This proves that stories do not materialize from a void but grow out of materials already available in history and human experience. There are about 7000 different languages around the world and they all differ from each other in sounds, structures and vocabularies (Lera Boroditsky, 2017). This means we have 7000 different cognitive realms and ways of experiencing the exchange of meaning. If language is a way of transmitting knowledge about experiences than that could mean that depending on the language you speak you can construct reality. for example, in the English language, we have the word <em>nostalgia</em> which translates to the experience of yearning to a past which you cannot retrieve. The Japanese version of the word nostalgia is Natsukashii 懐かしい which translates to the experience of looking back to the past with an appreciation for having that memory. The experience is more like that of the word ‘reminiscence’ but both nostalgia and reminiscence translate to ‘natsukashii’ in Japanese. They have no word fır yearning to go back to the past because the Japanese culture didn’t feel the need to verbalize such a feeling. Another example is that in Turkish you talk about the other as ‘o’, it is a way of referring to another person but without the revealing of their gender. There is no he or she in Turkish and no gender nouns towards object this also changes the experience of the perception of the material realm. These might be details which are self evident for the users making them unaware of that distinction but research by Dr.Lera Boroditsky as presented in her talk shows that the language you use guide the things you pay attention to in life. “language guides our reasonings around events.”</p>
<p>Another very critical point she makes towards the end of her talk is that everything we know about the human mind is based on studies of American/ English speaking undergraduates at universities and this means that it excludes all other human beings and what their contribution could be towards the understanding of the human mind. She correctly points out that our knowledge is narrow and biased. Linguistic diversity is not only about understanding the way how people live around the world it is also an opportunity for ourselves to question why we think the way we do.</p>
<h3 id="the-influencer"><span id="The_Influencer" class="mw-headline">The Influencer</span></h3>
<p>Groups of people that have no strong media presence are under the mercy of how dominant media displays them. Valuable cultures, traditions, rituals that have been developed in ancient societies to assist people in defining their purpose is being othered and marginalized by what dominant media defines and displays them as. The danger with normalizing the de-humanized state in which people are being portrayed is to allow them suffering at the hand of ill intentioned groups in power. We have no immediate contact with the senses and are thus depending on how they are represented to us.</p>
<p><em>‘The notion about bringing civilization to primitive or barbaric peoples, the disturbingly familiar ideas about flogging or death or extended punishment being required when ‘they’ misbehaved or became rebellious, because ‘they’ mainly understood force or violence best; ‘they’ were not like ‘us’, and for that reason deserved to be ruled.</em> -Edward Said, Culture And Imperialism, p.xiii</p>
<p>Everything we create we do so with the urge to translate our subjective experiences into the physical world which will make it possible for others to see, analyze and agree or disagree on (Brigit Bundesen, 2018). We are kidding ourselves when we produce work within the world of art and design with an ‘objective’ positioning assuming it to be ‘universal’ or ‘neutral’ (Ruben Pater, 2016). When we investigate what ‘objective’ or ‘universal’ means internally, how legit is it to even have that as a standard or ideal.</p>
<p>It is the governing perceptive from the collective agency that lingers in the mind of humans to classify fellow human being and to practice behavior upon them which will be a part of the narrative selves. This bares great consequential risks. Unfortunately, because we are driven with the force of survival we can behave in a very ugly way to our fellow human beings and surroundings. Just look at the news or history books; war, genocide, rape, slavery, torture, exploitation are all things that have happened and still linger amongst us. All the acts of violence committed out of disagreement on what reality should be. We classify people based on gender, race, sexual orientation and religion. We build these social constructions and agree on it. We punish and reward people as a result of these social constructions. We become aware of being an ‘other’ when we don’t share the characteristics to make us privileged.</p>
<p><em>“The arbitrary-set system is filled with socially constructed and highly salient groups based on characteristics such as clan, ethnicity, estate, nation, race, caste, social class, religious sect, regional groups, or any other socially relevant group distinction that the human imagination is capable of constructing”</em> -Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999, p. 33</p>
<p>Dr.Brigit Bundesen describes the state of suffering as a consequence of communication. Humans are very vulnerable in the face of a story, especially at infancy. The reason why we are so vulnerable towards stories is because stories are equipment for living (Kenneth Burke, 1974). As children we learn language because we need to be able to function and vocalize our needs, that is how our selves develops (Birgit Bundesen, 2018). What falls under language is not limited to the linguistic one, although we are accustomed to use that as the primary way of self-expression, we learn from infancy on a multitude of languages which we actively use. A habit is always difficult to explain in intellectual terms, because it feels so natural and self-evident.(Ien Ang, 1982)</p>
<p><em>“Once the public has decided to accept something as an interesting fact, it becomes almost impossible to get the acceptance rescinded. The persistent interestingness and symbolic usefulness overrides any lack of factuality.”</em> -Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Great Eskimo I I Vocabulary Hoax I and Other Irreverent Essays on the Study of Language, 1991</p>
<p>If the only representation we receive from the other is through the media coverage than we face the danger of being immersed in an unquestioned version of a single story (Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 2009). The Northern hemisphere is the area which is in control of influence, so powerful that it distributes a spectrum of stories of itself. We need more heroes of color that come from all sort of different places from the world because the metropolises are a micro representation of the diversity in the whole world. Social attitudes change, and makers must gain more awareness of this and have to be able to display stories that represents the richness in diversity. To keep on a tradition of celebrating one type of heroine and one type of antagonists is not storytelling, it is an act of upholding stereotypes. Children especially must be able to watch suitable role models on screen, they need to know that they matter. Kids now can operate a tablet sooner than they learn to walk and they watch everything. It is in infancy where we really place down our fundamental ways of perception. It takes more effort to un-learn false narratives and stereotypes because we’ll be blinded as adults unless harshly confronted with our narrative selves. Inclusive representation in animation is absolutely crucial.</p>
<h3 id="i.film"><span id="I.Film" class="mw-headline">I.Film</span></h3>
<p>There is a persistent impulse in our culture that finds professions or practices which show material result as the only ones that are worthy of respect. ‘only through imagination, which is always subjective, is objective reality assimilated: a life without imagination does not exist.’(Ien Ang, Watching Dallas). My fascination towards cinema has made me an empathetic person, I experienced that the mundane language of words fails to express subjective experiences but by distancing ourselves from our own identity and watching a character go through hardships on the screen we can learn from them and establish a better understanding of what we go through. Thanks to film, we can travel beyond the border of our own imagination and physical realms. We don’t question all the languages which we use such as traffic signs or letters, they serve their purpose and will remain unquestioned unless they cause an error, like a traffic accident, than we will start questioning the function and if it fulfills its purpose. Poetics which are founded in the art of storytelling are the opposite of functional linguistic tools. They serve as a mirror towards our conscious and subconscious self where we are confronted with the weight and nuance of life and are made to think. We are drawn to each other’s stories to learn about how others cope with the weight of existence and death.</p>
<p>An even more powerful and truer form of storytelling is animation. Animation does not rely on the existing world with its governing rules of physics. When creating animation, you create an entire altered cosmology of existence. You fill up a blank space with meaning and purpose, the creator will be continuously confronted with the question ‘what if?’</p>
<p><em>“The motive is always psychological; the artist must have something to communicate, for mastery over form is not his goal, but rather the adapting of the form to inner significance. That is beautiful which is produced by inner need, which springs from the soul”</em> -Kandinsky</p>
<p>With the craft of storytelling we can challenge the perception of stereotypes by offering a more layered representation including the diversity it deserves. It is especially a critical tool because the visual language of animation is something so popular with very young audiences. An age where the subconscious is being shaped and the basic perceptions are being formed that will be carried around for the rest of their lives. This will have influence on their ways of perceiving themselves and the other in a way that can contribute to their self-esteem and ability to contribute to their surroundings. Instead of creating a media archive that induces the need for consumption and where the archetypes are being reduced to stereotypes it should become a tool of poetics that will always provoke thought.</p>
<p><em>“the art of story is the dominant cultural force in the world, and the art of film is the dominant medium of this grand enterprise.”</em> -Robert McKee, Story, p.15</p>
<h4 id="conclusion"><span id="Conclusion" class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h4>
<p><em>“to tell the truth, in a world of lies and liars, an honest work of art is always an act of social responsibility”</em> -Robert Mckee</p>
<p>All of our experiences are coming from the mechanisms of predictive perception that stem from the basic drive to stay alive, we know it will all end for us one day and therefore we seek meaning and purpose in our time here and maybe even a time after that. Thanks to the alternative narratology that I was introduced to during my high school years I could break free from my superficial positioning. Maybe universality and objectivity can become possible in a far future where we have developed ourselves towards equal circumstances but if we keep feeding our younger generations with a tradition of stereotypes we won’t be able to reach that ideal equality. Today it feels meaningless to pursue ambitions that do not benefit to humanize back all the ‘others’ which have been de-humanized and normalized through systematic racism and discrimination to uphold power structures. Critical awareness about the self and breaking free of default certainties can only be challenged by the influence of the stories of the other. We can bond through sharing knowledge and create an understanding on the consequences of our actions.</p>
<p>Outside of the dominant white narrative structure which we are used to consume there is an entire world filled with significant amounts of alternative communicative languages beyond that of the spoken and written word that serve as a tool of self-expression and bonding. History is an inexhaustible source of story material. Everything, everywhere and everyone has a history. By examining the culture of a community, you learn about their values and distinctive characteristics that have evolved throughout their history and values are the soul of storytelling. We need to visualize these stories to create a more inclusive animation industry. The only thing which is universal is death, we all know that we are going to die and a self-actualized human being is the one that can use their creative skills to benefit their influence zone. Whether it is your country, your city, a classmate or a sibling we have this ability of communication which we can use to benefit each other instead of oppressing one another.</p>
<p>My research gave me a much-needed insight as I was always on a mission to reach objectivity or a universal positioning which I thought I would definitely be able to attain through the lens of sciences. Of course, I haven’t found it, we can only examine what we perceive and hope that what we find leads to another discovery. Consciousness is an experience and not a tangible thing, over analyzing this creates existential dizziness. The realization that our media whether in the face of news or entertainment is not an overall or universal representation of what is out there in the world will help us strip down the artificial tools of oppression that allows human suffering. I understand that by making our similarities more evident instead of our socially constructed differences, we can strive to create a society with more inclusion and awareness of the other in an appreciative way. This is why it is crucial to tell the stories that have been kept on hold.</p>

<p>a genderless project<br />

<p>An ongoing conversation piece about a fundamental part of identity, one that can is approached both subjectively as objectively.<br />
Identity is not merely established within private spaces, as a matter of fact, I would consider this -in some extent- a secondary factor.<br />
It is more likely, that by trying to understand and/or control our constructed society, we have created multitude ways to categorise and identify ourselves and others.<br />
As observed, current ways of identification often aim to protest “outdated” norms and values.</p>
<p><br />
<em>‘GIVE ME YOUR NAME – a genderless project’</em> is an ongoing art project, developed by Studio Framis and supported by The Art of Impact, that focuses on displays of identities in public spaces.<br />
Aiming to increase awareness on diversity and the complexity of identity, initiate a political debate on removal of identification in passports and question/provide knowledge on the gender binary through a public debate.<br />
Envisioning a society without gender divisions, going beyond the binary.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Through collaboration with Transgender Netwerk Nederland, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Archis, Creative Time in New York, the Kunsthalle Nürnberg in Germany<br />
and from the corporate sector, IMC (provides financial support) and ProtoSpace 3D, Studio Framis (Alicia Framis, Laura A. Dima, Julia Lourie and Lilet Breddels) seeks to realise the project’s visions.</p>
<p><br />
The project kickstarted in February 2016 by conducting research over a period of five months to expand their network of experts and knowledge on gender diversity.<br />
This newly acquired knowledge would then be translated into different designs and artistic expressions. In September the outcomes where introduced during a symposium held at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.</p>

Laura A. Dima’s research on new architecture within the context of gender diversity, insights of architectural professor Beatriz Colomina and interviews conducted with households of non-binary structures,<br />
brought to attention the lack of architectural space that is provided for these households. This led to the establishment of <em>‘Century 22 Real Estate’</em>, a real-estate company that develops housing for non-binary families.<br />
Artistically expressed through films, models, performances, drawings and a magazine as its means to communicate with society.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On January 13, the concept of ‘Century 22’ was introduced at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, by organising an evening consisting of a performance and film by Alicia Framis and a lecture by prof. Beatriz Colomina.<br />
<em>“To engage the audience with the project, brochures with information about the alternative housing projects were handed out, which could function as conversation starter at the after talks.”</em></p>
<p><br />
This year the project will move forward internationally by participating in a transgender manifestation in New York in collaboration with Creative Time, at Festival of Human Rights in Kunsthalle Nürnberg and at the Migros Museum in Zurich.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h5 id="to-conclude"><span id="To_conclude" class="mw-headline">To conclude</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h5>
<p>Understanding and accepting all representations of identity is a crucial matter of concern, that has to be taken in account when working towards a better society.</p>
<p><br />
<em>‘GIVE ME YOUR NAME – a genderless project’</em> and <em>‘Century 22’</em>, focus on the basic element of identity, representations of alternative genders.<br />
Extensive research, (international) collaboration, encouraging participation by organising talks and artistic expression of their observations using film and performance,<br />
leads me to believe the project suffices to what would be identified as a good social art and design project.</p>
<p><br />
Providing a voice for a community that is often wrongfully portrayed in the media and finding a new approach in making them part of society.<br />
By choosing film and performance as medium, I believe their visions are better communicated, as these are more intriguing methods and attracts more interest.</p>
<p><br />
Though the current path of the project has some strong aspects, initially it was directed towards the transgender community. The way they’re often portrait in de media, resulted in them being quite reluctant to participate.<br />
Without using the transgender image, the project shifted to a broader range of gender identities. This makes the project more general, which gives it more possibilities, but also means more input and might result in a longer process of change.</p>
<p><br />
As the project is still ongoing, I’m curious to the effects it will have and so will follow up on their progress. Despite the issue around representations of certain genders in the media, I would like to see a more personal approach in ways of communicating gender diversity, besides architectural necessities.<br />
What comes after these needs are fulfilled?</p>

		<div class="article_content"><p>I. What is the program about?<br />
</p>
<p>Designmatters is an educational Department at ArtCenter College of Design that engages all academic disciples taught at the college with a dynamic, entrepreneurial and experiential approach to design education and social innovation. Designmatters serves as a vibrant hub for strategic collaborations near and far from ArtCenter’s campuses in Pasadena. In 2002, Designmatters established the significant and pioneering affiliation of the College as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations as part of its international outreach strategy. For more than fifteen years, the department has built a broad network of innovative research and project-based collaborations with social, public and private sector organizations regionally, nationally and internationally.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Designmatters is at the helm of a diverse set of educational initiatives, special projects and publications that demonstrate the power of design for social innovation: an emergent field of design inquiry and practice that is oriented toward new possibilities for action and human progress.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Designmatters collaborates closely with partners, faculty, and students to use the power of design to address complex challenges in the areas of Sustainable Development, Public Policy, Global Health and Social Entrepreneurship. Designmatters facilitates an exploratory, lab-like environment where the expertise of multidisciplinary faculty guides the fresh perspectives of students to uncover nuanced insights that lead to unexpected, creative and viable solutions.  <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The Department helps conceive an average of three original transdisciplinary elective courses (signature Designmatters projects open to undergraduate and graduate students from all disciplines) every academic term; manages the Designmatters Fellowship program; oversees the Designmatters Concentration for undergraduate students who choose to specialize in social impact design; and collaborates with the Graduate Media Design Practices Field Track in managing the UNICEF Innovation partnership that informs the field experience offered within this MFA curriculum.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Designmatters is equally committed to offering students a unique set of learning outcomes that come from the constraints of working collaboratively at multifaceted levels of complexity and community, as well as to acting as a guarantor with organizational partners for project implementation.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>II. What should we (not) teach students within social practices? <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Through the Designmatters studio experience, students are taught design methods and tools that support social innovation outcomes. These can be categorized in approximately 3 key areas that represent pillars of the innovative pedagogy offered:<br />
1) Co-creation and collaboration through participatory research methods:<br />
Design briefs are structured within a very collaborative framework that includes field research and multiple touch-points for critique and feedback with external stakeholders and potential beneficiaries of the design intervention(s) at hand. This process is central to the learning offered and exposes students to the perspectives and expertise of actors from various sectors and disciplines. There is an emphasis on unique participatory research methodologies that build empathy with the end-users; the objective is to address the needs and aspirations of individuals and communities in a holistic way that engages participants in cooperatively informing the design research and creative problem-solving process as much as possible throughout the overall arc of investigation and development of the project(s).<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>2) Trans-disciplinary and team-based project approach to collaboration:<br />
This is an important hallmark learning of Designmatters studios. Students from across design disciplines form teams to solve real-time/ real-world challenges in a “reflection-in-action” mode of inquiry that enables them to actively experiment and incorporate experience-based insights, judgment and intuition. Each student brings individual life experiences, diverse cultural upbringings, and varied strengths in design skill-sets from their core academic design discipline. The collaborative process facilitates dialogue, feedback, critical thinking, delegation, leadership and, ultimately, teamwork. This is also a process that gradually promotes flexibility, adaptive learning and confidence building to work with the kinds of interdependent and complex challenges of the social design briefs that students encounter in Designmatters studios.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>3) Integration of the college’s liberal arts curriculum into studio instruction.<br />
Designmatters trans-disciplinary studios expose students to broad-learning opportunities that are the hallmark of a vital 21st century liberal arts education, allowing them to connect their questions and concerns with a sense of ethical and civic responsibility and a critical understanding of the social issues that they are tackling. Depending on the nature of the design brief that is being addressed, domain experts from various fields of the social and hard sciences are invited as guest faculty and/or in advisory capacities to inform students’ research and inquiry and prepare them to make relevant connections and apply this knowledge to their design ideation process.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>III. In what way is this education different from education for traditional creative disciplines?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The most singular and distinctive aspect of the educational model offered in the trans-disciplinary Designmatters studios is their human-centered and immersive quality—one connected to the real-time/real-world framework of this experiential and project-based model of learning. Furthermore, because there is always an aspiration to collaborate with external partners to create novel and useful solutions that may be implemented after the educational engagement is over, students often receive training and support to incubate projects beyond the confines of the initial development of the project in the studio.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2001, Designmatters has produced over 100 social innovation design projects, including print and multi-media campaigns, documentaries, public service announcements, educational toolkits, products, installations, and more. Over 90% of these projects have moved forward to real-world implementation by our strategic partners. In this way, Designmatters students are able to see their current work in action and recognize the positive impact their designs have on different levels of scale, from the local to the global.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>IV. Include a student project as an example (of co-creation and collaboration)?<br />
</p>
<p>In partnership with Coaniquem, a non-profit pediatric treatment facility in Santiago, Chile, that cares for young burn victims free of charge, the Spring 2016 Designmatters studio, SAFE Niños, challenged students to co-create with stakeholders to reinvigorate the 6-acre campus with engaging indoor and outdoor environments that would be welcoming and therapeutic for patients, their parents, and medical professionals.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Empathic co-creation was paramount to the success of SAFE Niños: the studio included multiple opportunities for students and faculty to conduct ethnographic research and field-testing in the setting of the clinic to ideate, prototype and validate design solutions. The basis for the studio syllabus was co-creation, with all decision making and learning happening in the form of carefully orchestrated opportunities for students to interact with patients and their families of Coaniquem as well as medical staff and incorporate experience-based insights to the ongoing creation and refinement of possible solutions. Observation, sense making and a wide array of participatory design research methods allowed students to develop concepts based on a reflective understanding of Coaniquem stakeholder’s needs and aspirations.<br />
Students were inspired by the holistic nature of working together as a unified team for a common good, and they advocated to create one overriding concept with interconnected elements, featuring the students’ individual talents. This innovative approach to collaboration enabled students to function like a real-world studio, acting as a cohesive unit and approaching a problem from many different angles.<br />

<div class="intro">
<p>Why do we aspire to an inclusive city? How can social art and design contribute to this effort? Which concrete social art and design practices will be we able to realise? With whom and for whom? These questions are at the core of the multi-year programme ‘Line 23’ which is being implemented in three neighbourhoods of Rotterdam. The programme is an initiative of the department of Social Art and Design at the Willem de Kooning Academy (WdKA) in Rotterdam, in collaboration with an expanding learning community of civic and professional partners, in the city and far beyond, who share some of the same questions and ambitions.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-social-as-a-learning-community"><span id="Beyond_Social_as_a_learning_community" class="mw-headline">Beyond Social as a learning community</span></h3>
<p>Beyond Social serves as a platform for sharing thoughts, experiences and the results of this programme, both within the learning community and with a wider audience. Everyone is invited to publish in this wiki and to join our events. The focus of this editorial is to promote interaction and to assist you in finding your way within our various activities.</p>
<h3 id="city-of-contrasts"><span id="City_of_contrasts" class="mw-headline">City of contrasts</span></h3>
<p>Rotterdam may rightly call itself a metropolis. The underdog with its residents of countless nationalities seems to always be reinventing itself. The city’s dynamism has been noted far beyond the country’s borders. But how is this experienced within the city itself? Which prospects does this dynamism actually provide to its residents? Optimistically inclined Rotterdammers have traditionally described the DNA of their city as ‘entrepreneurial’, ‘raw’ and ‘international’. The city now boldly positions itself as a frontrunner of the ‘next economy’. Others however see a completely different picture: for them, Rotterdam is still the city where ‘urban problems’ can be written in capital letters, with a grim reality of inequality and exclusion – particularly for the younger, culturally diverse generation. Like many other metropolises, Rotterdam is thus a city of contrasts. Both perspectives are true. But are they also compatible?</p>
<h3 id="why-an-inclusive-city"><span id="Why_an_inclusive_city.3F" class="mw-headline">Why an inclusive city?</span></h3>
<p>Is an inclusive development of the city even possible? And why is this something we should want to invest in? What is the underlying context? What are the challenges? We have been exploring local, international, individual and public perceptions, policies and strategies of how and why to aim for inclusivity in our society and in a metropolis such as Rotterdam. Interesting references include a recent World Bank study on inclusive cities, the Rotterdam municipal government’s own Urban Agenda, and of course the strategies of our local partners and their international networks. We invite experts in the field, as well as students, citizens, artists and scientists to reflect upon this theme. In Beyond Social you will find contributions by experts such as the artist Quincy Gario and the political philosopher Tina Rahimy, alongside a number of design fictions proposed by WdKA students.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-become-a-game-changer"><span id="How_to_become_a_.E2.80.98game_changer.E2.80.99" class="mw-headline">How to become a ‘game changer’</span></h3>
<p>Will the new generation of creative entrepreneurs be in a position to contribute to an inclusive development of the city? How can an art and design academy such as the WdKA contribute to this development as optimally as possible? In order to find answers to these questions, we are currently exploring a variety of approaches and positions in the field of social art and design. How does it work? Why does it work? We are also well aware that it is far from obvious to combine on one hand the educational objectives and requirements of an art and design academy and its students, and on the other hand the urgency of the communities and local partners in dealing effectively with today’s far-reaching transitions and ‘wicked’ social problems. However, to us, refraining from active engagement is simply not an option. Therefore we must find ways of optimising the relationship between education and practice in a long-term relationship – combining action and learning in the best possible way. This quest was the starting point of a Community of Practice which we have now called ‘Line 23’.</p>
<h3 id="community-of-practice-line-23"><span id="Community_of_Practice_.E2.80.98Line_23.E2.80.99" class="mw-headline">Community of Practice ‘Line 23’</span></h3>
<p>The multi-year programme ‘Line 23’ was launched in 2016 in three Rotterdam neighbourhoods. Our aim is to contribute to the realisation of an inclusive city, while at the same time continuing to learn how to do so as effectively as possible. The programme is being implemented in the neighbourhoods Bospolder-Tussendijken / Merwe-Vierhavens (Delfshaven district), Afrikaanderwijk (Feijenoord district) and Beverwaard (IJsselmonde district), in collaboration with local partners such as CultuurConcreet, Bouwkeet, Delfshaven Coöperatie, Bibliotheek Rotterdam, Freehouse, Afrikaanderwijk Coöperatie, Veldacademie, IJsselwijs, and the Erasmus University Medical Center, with whom we are addressing various issues related to the social DNA of these neighbourhoods and experimenting with ‘inclusive’ approaches to the ‘next economy’, gentrification, and promoting healthy lifestyles. The name ‘Line 23’ refers to tram line 23 which crosses through Rotterdam from Northwest to Southeast, from Delfshaven to Beverwaard, thus connecting the three districts involved. Line 23 is also known as one of the longest tram lines in the Netherlands. Our Community of Practice explicitly identifies with these notions of traversing and connecting the city, and of opting for the long range.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-first-results"><span id="What_are_the_first_results.3F" class="mw-headline">What are the first results?</span></h3>
<p>Bouwkeet opened its doors during the second half of 2016, with the ambition to foster the ‘21st-century skills’ of youngsters in Bospolder-Tussendijken. Afrikaanderwijk Coöperatie was awarded the ‘right to challenge’ the waste problems and opportunities of the Afrikaanderplein street market. IJsselwijs, with the support of Veldacademie, launched an ambitious pilot project addressing the serious obesity issues of youngsters in Beverwaard. Approximately 70 third-year students and some 10 lecturers of the Social Design department have joined these and other similar initiatives, with the aim of offering a positive contribution to their success. We intend to continue these efforts in 2017, 2018 and onward. The first results of our Community of Practice are being published in this wiki, and presented and discussed at the Beyond Social Event on February 9, 2017, where a number of experts and students involved will share their experiences. Below you can find more information about this event, as well as links to relevant articles and contributions. This is only the beginning of a multi-year programme of action and learning. You are cordially invited to join us.</p>

Giving shape to the process and the financing is just as important as the design itself. I strongly believe that design can act as an agent for social renewal, and lead to strategies that contribute to a circular and inclusive economy. Circular in the sense of transforming energy, water, waste and material cycles into closed cycles. Inclusive in the sense of creating implementation trajectories that empower people who are otherwise removed from the labour market.

I strongly believe that design can act as an agent for social renewal, and lead to strategies that contribute to a circular and inclusive economy. Circular in the sense of transforming energy, water, waste and material cycles into closed cycles. Inclusive in the sense of creating implementation trajectories that empower people who are otherwise removed from the labour market. In my presentation at the WdKA symposium 'Redesigning Business'(Rotterdam, November 20 2014) I explained the working methods, struggles and solutions of circular and inclusive economy, for example through the futuristic design for the 'Biobased Retrofit House'.</p>

In the summer of 2011 a group of dedicated students and young professionals from MOME EcoLab, the sustainability research group of Moholy Nagy University of Art and Design Budapest in Hungary, travelled to the remote Bodva valley, one of the poorest regions of Europe, to meet and help local Roma communities living in extreme poverty. The aim of the visit was to start a long-term social design project which would have relevant impacts. After four years of multiple failures, dozens of dead-ends and lots of work, the group is just about ready to understand &quot;how to make it work&quot;

WdKA Student project: What can still be done in a household when it comes to reuse? A new use for every inch of trash can be found on the internet, so Anniek van Mierlo wanted to challenge herself to find a piece of home that was still unexplored. She searched for places that weren't likely to be used for reuse and found one place in the form of a very filthy drain...

WdKA Student project: When I started studying fashion at WdKA, six years ago, it took some time to settle in a practice-oriented curriculum, since what I had expected on entering was to graduate one day with a collection of eight outfits presented in a ‘classic’ fashion show. But because times had changed, WdKA had changed too. So I changed as well, and over these past six years I started to critically question the fashion system we still are familiar with today.

WdKA Student project: The concept of communal is in crisis. We believe it's because collectivity it isn’t an obvious given cultural factor anymore. Rotterdam will need creative entrepreneurs to constantly visualize the communal and inclusivity as our society no longer knows what this means. We live in a society that still sees a lot of individualism. Inclusive development of a society consists of ensuring that all marginalized and excluded groups are stakeholders in development processes. Which means that there is need of collaboration before we can even speak of the concept inclusive development. We, as creative entrepreneurs, can become an (in)visible bridges between individuals and stakeholders, stakeholders and marginalized and excluded groups. Bridges looking for new connections between art and society where co-creation and social- extracurricular issues are at the center of the solutions.

<p>WdKA Student Project: As a sustainable mindset designer I strongly believe that we have to break our old cultural mindsets down in order to live sustainably.</p>
In our current cultural mindset we are placing our self-made systems above the ecosystem. We are no longer listening to what mother earth is telling us. This project can be the first step for us, to create a culture in which the ecosystem is the most important system. This could be possible if we would translate the needs of the ecosystem into our own language. Resulting in the situation where everything we will create from now on, will be submissive to mother earth.

WdKA Student project: When it comes to cultural diversity in Rotterdam, the neighbourhood called 'Oude Noorden' (Old North) seems the place to be. Migration, integration and multiculturalism come together in this vibrant part of the city, sometimes causing friction but also leading to wonderful collaborations and events. An example is the local community centre 'De Mozaïek'. Twice a week, in Resto VanHarte, people can enjoy a meal that is just as diverse as the neighbourhood's population. However, we found it striking that the majority of visitors is typically Dutch, quite in contrast with the kitchen team that seems to represent integration. We were wondering how a meal prepared by such a multicultural team could be consumed by what appeared to us to be a very non-multicultural (and possibly even anti-multicultural) group?

Near the Van Hasselt canal and the IJ in Amsterdam-Noord, a former ship wharf now hosts a very special association of creative and social entrepreneurs called De Ceuvel. De Ceuvel is run by a group of architects, landscape architects, artists, photographers, designers, etc. who have an amazing approach that combines sustainability and social motives, stimulates the local economy (keeping transportation costs low) and proves to be a laboratory for (alternative) cultural, social and economic development in an autarkic and 'Do-It-Yourself' manner.

Six years ago Renate Boere worried about the populist style of communication of certain politicians. By making clever use of the 'voice of the people' these political leaders were able to gain a great deal of support in a short period of time. Renate Boere asked herself, 'can I, as a designer, do something about this?'

WdKA Student Project: I started this project because I feel this the subject of indoctrination is of utmost relevance in our day and age. We always talk about the outcome of indoctrination, with mass media focusing on the latest terrorist attacks or airing TV shows like “My life in a cult”. We hardly talk about the process itself. There is never just one 'red flag' moment, there are however a lot of little 'pink' ones that together can make a real impact on a child's future decisions.

WdKA Studentproject: The RDM (Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappij) is a former shipbuilding wharf located in a remote area in the harbour of Rotterdam. Due to the isolated location, the company built the village of Heijplaat in 1914 to provide housing for its employees. Since the 1990s however the area has undergone a series of important transformations, many of which have had a negative impact on the local population. My project 'Samenspel' focused on this specific location, and also on the question: how to reshape the connection between the RDM wharf and the village? Can I design (the implementation of) a new function for the RDM that attracts the local population?

WdKA Studentproject: There are currently 2.3 million people with disabilities living in the Netherlands. Ten years after the 2006 United Nations convention on the rights of disabled people, little has changed in the Netherlands; we have actually become one of the most inaccessible countries in Europe. The project Wheelshare is based on the fact that wheelchair users feel visible for the wrong reasons, but that they also know better than anyone else which places are the most inaccessible. Wheelshare faciliates them to raise awareness on this issue.

Most existing research in oncology focuses on methods of treatment such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Few research projects so far have concentrated on supportive cancer care for children. This is why we have conducted a 'research through design' project to design, implement and evaluate interventions that stimulate adequate eating and exercising behaviour among children with cancer and their families. Our project is entitled POKO, a three-year funded project (September 2013 – December 2016).

WdKA Student project: Inspired by the open online collection of the Rijksmuseum, being a product designer, the old measuring instruments attracted the attention of Elise van Beurden. The standard metre represents the transition to the metric system as a tool. Before that, body parts were used as measurements for trading and differed per city. Van Beurden researched how personal measurements could be used again for design.

<p>sustainable (new earth) lifestyle design</p>
Since 1990, mandatory nutrition fact labeling on packaged food products in the U.S. has made it easier for consumers to shop for foods based on dietary restrictions and nutritional requirements. But just because a food bears a healthy nutrition label doesn't mean it was ethically or sustainably produced.

<p>sustainable (new earth) fashion design</p>
Over the past few years, clothing has been treated more and more like a disposable product. The production of clothing is aimed for increasing numbers and production to decrease prices. Low prices seem attractive, but what does this way of producing mean for the future of the environment and the people that work in this industry? The Post-Couture Collective offers an alternative to today’s fashion system. It introduces a new era in the production of sustainable and affordable clothing. In our vision clothing is designed on the principles of open-source, and is made using 21st century technology. It is the first fashion label that truly embraces the Maker Movement and the Third Industrial Revolution.

With our team, supporters and project partners we have developed the design of a stool and created a production proces for the PET fabric that is easy to implement in Peru’s weaving communities.

<p>Sustainable (new earth) advertising</p>
Green Graffiti is a form of advertisement where something is removed, like dirt on walls, to reveal a negative (whitespace) image. It uses for example water to clean the surface but uses no other resources than the existing wall. It can therefore be argued that by not using more materials than conventional advertisements on billboards and screens and such, this is a more environmentally friendly form of advertising.

Mayor of Delfshaven is a documentary about Ladan, a woman from Iran. For the past 23 year she has run a special hair salon in Rotterdam West. With this documentary, we want to impress on the viewer the importance of her place, but also the importance of the social contact. The documentary comes with a photo-reportage about her work and the people in the salon.

The Designmatters department of the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena has the same ambition as the WdKA: to foster a strong connection between education and practice. We are at the helm of a diverse set of educational initiatives, special projects and publications that demonstrate the power of design for social innovation: an emergent field of design inquiry and practice that is oriented toward new possibilities for action and human progress. I will briefly explain here how we connect to practices in the field and how we perceive the future role of designers in society.

<h3 id="vibrant-hub-for-strategic-collaborations"><span id="Vibrant_hub_for_strategic_collaborations" class="mw-headline">Vibrant hub for strategic collaborations</span></h3>
<p>'Designmatters' is an educational department (non-degree granting) that engages all majors taught at the College with a dynamic, entrepreneurial and experiential approach to design education. Designmatters serves as a vibrant hub for strategic collaborations near and far from ArtCenter's campuses in Pasadena. In 2002, Designmatters established the significant and pioneering affiliation of the College as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) with the United Nations. For more than a decade, the department has built a broad network of innovative collaborations with social, public and private sector organizations that are striving to design a better and more humane future for all.</p>
<h3 id="human-centered-and-immersive-quality"><span id="Human-centered_and_immersive_quality" class="mw-headline">Human-centered and immersive quality</span></h3>
<p>The most singular and distinctive aspect of the educational model offered in the trans-disciplinary Designmatters studios is their human-centered and immersive quality – one connected to the real-time/real-world framework of this experiential and project-based model of learning. Furthermore, because there is always an aspiration to collaborate with external partners to create novel and useful solutions that may be implemented after the educational engagement is over, students often receive training and support to incubate projects beyond the confines of the initial development of the project in the studio. Since its inception in 2001, Designmatters has produced over 100 social innovation design projects, including print and multimedia campaigns, documentaries, public service announcements, educational toolkits, products, installations, and more. Over 90% of these projects have moved forward to real-world implementation by our strategic partners. In this way, Designmatters students are able to see their current work in action and recognize the positive impact their designs have on different levels of scale, from the local to the global.</p>
<h3 id="the-leap-dialogues"><span id="The_LEAP_Dialogues" class="mw-headline">The LEAP Dialogues</span></h3>
<p>The role of design and designers in society and the marketplace is changing. We wish to anticipate upon that. Recently we published The LEAP Dialogues about why these changes are happening, which skills are needed to stay relevant, and how new practices are emerging. The focus is on career pathways for designers in social innovation. Below you will find two excepts from these LEAP Dialogues, which we hope may inspire you in your own development.</p>
<h4 id="excerpt-1-overcoming-limitations-in-social-design"><span id="Excerpt_1:_Overcoming_Limitations_in_Social_Design" class="mw-headline">Excerpt 1: Overcoming Limitations in Social Design</span></h4>
<p><strong>A Dialogue between Valerie Casey, Founder and Executive Director, and the designers Accord &amp; Barry Katz, California College of the Arts</strong></p>
<p>VC: To designers looking for ways to actively engage in these nearly intractable challenges, I would give three pieces of clear advice:</p>
<p>Creativity in itself is not novel; it's the execution of creative ideas that matters. All ideas sound brilliant and life-changing as they roll around inside our heads. But as designers, that's not enough. We are uniquely equipped to make things: to build, code, draw, write. My definition of a successful idea is one that can change people, at scale. In social impact, there is no room for vanity projects. Focus on making and reaching.</p>
<p>Study your subject. This is no place for the beginner's mind. There has been a prevailing belief in the design community that designers we will be less capable of expansive, creative thought if they are tainted with too much information about their subjects. The designer's conceit is to view the world with fresh eyes, unencumbered with context and knowledge. When trying to make a meaningful impact on large social problems, this is a failing strategy. It is critical to do deep preparatory work in order to really understand the complexities of the systems that shape these areas. It is just naive and limiting (and offensive) to try design an intervention in an impoverished neighborhood with the same method used to design a bicycle helmet.</p>
<p>Learn math. The healthcare system in the United States is built on an accounting system. Venture capital investment is dictating the pace of technology. Data and predictive science is fueled by advertising platforms. Regardless of skill-set and discipline, no one can engage in making social change without understanding the economic conditions that govern these systems. Financial fluency is the biggest advantage designers can have if they truly want to have impact.</p>
<p>Do you agree, Barry? Any sacred cows in design that you think we need to kill in order to unlock new thinking and capabilities?</p>
<p>BK: Our thinking is very closely aligned here. In fact, I am inclined to amplify some of your key points and explore some of their implications. I have done my fair share in promoting the idea of 'design thinking', but I sometimes fear that we have created a monster that has taken on a life of its own. The core concept, in my mind, was always the notion that the methods and techniques – and what you very rightly emphasize as the 'craft' – of the designer can be applied on a vastly expanded scale: from discrete electromechanical devices to integrated socioeconomic systems; from symptoms of dysfunction to the causes of dysfunction; from products to processes. But it was never my belief that this principle could be reduced to a five-part methodology that could be taught in a three-hour workshop, and voila! everybody is now a certified 'design thinker'! There's some evidence that this misconception has already begun to take a bite out of the practices of some of our local consultancies, as former clients scramble to deploy Design Thinking units within their organizations. I think it was Winston Churchill who said, 'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' There is a positive note to this, however, and in this respect I absolutely share your sense of optimism and (if I'm not mistaken) excitement: I believe that the extraordinary popularity of design thinking, and the growing recognition that the skills, thought processes and craft of the designer can be applied not just to solving problems but to identifying opportunities, and will create a receptiveness to the level of professionalism that is really required if we are to address the truly 'wicked' problems of our time. I brush and I floss, but I still go to the dentist.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the crisis that beset the design community when MacDraw and MacPaint seemed poised to turn every secretary, middle-school student and scrapbooker into a 'graphic designer'. For a moment there was panic across the land, but the unexpected result was to press the professional community to articulate with clarity and precision the value that it added. We are perhaps at such a point today: The example of Apple, the incorporation of design into the operations of venture capital firms, hospitals, nongovernmental organizations, financial institutions – even the military – has given the design community the opening it has dreamed of literally for decades. Designers need to stop complaining and learn to take 'yes' for an answer.</p>
<p>So what are we to do, now that we have gained the credibility we have sought for so long? Where will we start? How should we begin to apply our craft to problems that matter?</p>
<h4 id="excerpt-2-learn-before-you-leap-lessons-from-design-educators."><span id="Excerpt_2:_Learn_Before_You_Leap.3F_Lessons_from_Design_Educators." class="mw-headline">Excerpt 2: Learn Before You Leap? Lessons from Design Educators.</span></h4>
<p><strong>By Allan Chochinov, Chair, MFA Products of Design, School of Visual Arts &amp; Partner, Core 77</strong></p>
<p>Below you will find an assortment of answers from some of the leading thinkers and practitioners in American design education. They were asked a couple of questions: 'What are the essential qualities or skills to master in order to thrive in the potential professional roles available to them?' and 'What are your aspirations for the kinds of professional roles and career pathways you wish your students might be able to access in the future?' The answers were diverse in content, yet singular in profile – they were humanistic and they were ethical. And no wonder: since social design is fundamentally social, words like 'empathic' and 'conversation' and 'listening' and 'confidence' appear repeatedly. But even more ubiquitous were notions around responsibility, criticality, values, meaning and positive change. Indeed, there is an underlying desire for fairness and equity that distinguishes this kind of design work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, where most of design practice these days prides itself on being 'user centered', social design educators include the planet, other living things and all of the intermingled systems that bind them as protagonists in their work. It is this holistic approach that is perhaps most urgently needed in schools, along with the time and space for students to develop an individual moral compass.</p>
<p>Finally, they were emphatic. Repeatedly, educators talked about leadership, about impact and about transformation. These are big terms demanded for big challenges, and each seemed confident in a better future.</p>
<p>As an illustration we end this expert with some answers from Educators looking to the future. We asked them: what are the essential qualities and/or skills your students should master in order to thrive in the potential professional roles available to them?</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Gerber, Northwestern University</strong></p>
<p><em>Three E's: Empathy, Experimentation and Enthusiasm.</em></p>
<p><strong>Shalini Agrawal, CCA</strong> The single most important skill today's creative practitioner should master is the ability to listen. Listening is the foundation of collaboration and should be developed as a core competency. It places new professionals at the nexus of discovering innovative opportunities and redefining the face of leadership. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>Mike Weikert, Maryland Institute College of Art:</strong></p>
<p><em>Students must be lifelong learners and purposeful questioners, committed to gaining a higher level of social literacy. Add a combination of inherent qualities (creative, intuitive, humble, empathetic, optimistic, respectful, collaborative, fearless) and acquired skills (design research, process, systems, storytelling, visualization, facilitation, entrepreneurship) and future designers will thrive.</em></p>
<p><strong>Debera Johnson, Pratt Institute:</strong></p>
<p><em>Mastery in curiosity, listening, empathy, respect and the patience for allowing for things to evolve within a system will be critical for making change. My favorite quote lately is a Chinese proverb: The time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.</em></p>

<p><strong>OPEN CALL</strong></p>
<p>This issue of Beyond Social discusses different strategies of change in relation to current social issues. You are cordially invited to, from a designer perspective, compare your own practice with current innovations and theories in the field of social design and to address questions of change: what are our thoughts on how to bring about change as a designer or artist?</p>
<p>As a social designer, we hope to make meaningful changes to the people and the environment for whom we are designing. There are different perspectives on how to initiate this change. According to Pascal Gielen (2011), some of these changes focus more on working with the power structures and trying to make a difference within the boundaries of the 'System World'. Others try to make a stance against the current power structures (Gielen, 2011).</p>
<p>How do we ensure that the commons truly benefit from the changes we bring about, as opposed to the institutions? How do we cope with repressive liberalism, which is embodied in things like “Corporate Social Responsibility” and “Sustainability”? In other words, do we try to challenge system standards from the inside, do we pose an alternative system or do we take a radical position against the current system?</p>
<p>Feel free to contribute by adding an article on Beyond Social!</p>

To provoke change can be difficult as a placemaker. After each project you’ve finished you tend to look back and ask yourself; did it matter, did people understand the meaning of the project, did they see the value of the project and also important could I ‘capitalize’ that value, or knowledge, which isn’t always to be measured in ‘hard cash’?

As a result of the financial crisis and ongoing social transitions, old certainties have become fluid and new business models are emerging: business models in which the basis of multiple value creation is provided by new and existing cash flows, local entrepreneurship, social capital, open networks, energy transition and new technologies. An increasing number of designers and artists play an important role in the development of these new business models.

<p>Speak the language. Speak the language of different social groups, the language of the business world, the language of government. The language of the art world.</p>
If you do not speak the language of the person in front of you, you start with a disadvantage. And in social art, the person in front of you can be anybody.

The reason I selected this article is that Afaina's essay is entered around one of the important issues affecting social designers: public space and spatial inequality and hierarchies. As she writes, &quot;this slow death of public space is a contributing factor in the growth of non-inclusive cities that lack social coherence and actual participation.&quot; It is essential that we think about this and actively fight for a more inclusive public space.

“In the neighborhood of Delfshaven you'll find a social foundation under every street tile” according to Minister of Social Affairs Hugo de Jonge in his period as alderman in the city of Rotterdam. The area with 75.000 inhabitants is in terms of the neighborhood index (income, safety, etc) comparable to some the worst performing neighborhoods in the south of Rotterdam but with one major difference: It is -even compared to other national and European examples- exeptionally rich in citizens initiatives. The hell is going on there in the west of Rotterdam? And what role do social designers play in these networks?
